# ApxInf

ApxInf is a reimagined edge inference engine born of the agentic coding era,
combining high performance, reliability, and energy efficiency across devices
with an evolving agentic workflow that radically simplifies custom model development.

- implemented with system language Rust with no other externel dependencies
- embodied AI is highest priority, VLA/WAM models on Jetson/DriveOS Thor/Orin
- Agentically optimized CUDA Kernels

The first version of ApxInf ships with highly optimized PI-0.5 VLA model on Jetson Thor &
Orin devices, and supports BF16, FP8 and INT8 precisions.


## Quick start

Make sure you have ApxInf built and installed, see [Build ApxInf](#build-apxinf) for instructions.

### Quickly benchmarking PI-0.5

Benchmarking PI-0.5 with randomly generated weights.

```bash
python scripts/bench_pi05.py --random-weights --model-variant bf16 --layer l1 \
  --views 2 --token-count 10 --action-horizon 10 --num-flow-steps 10 \
  --warmup 10 --samples 100 --autotune
```

```bash
python scripts/bench_pi05.py --random-weights --model-variant fp8_static --layer l1 \
  --views 2 --token-count 10 --action-horizon 10 --num-flow-steps 10 --autotune
```

Reported latency is P50 over 30 samples after 10 warm-up iterations
(`--warmup` / `--samples`).

### Run a policy through Python API

```python
import numpy as np
from apxinf import AutoPolicy

policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained("<path-to-model>", model_variant="bf16")

observation = {
    key: np.zeros((256, 256, 3), np.uint8)
    for key in policy.metadata["image_keys"]
}
observation[policy.metadata["prompt_key"]] = "put both moka pots on the stove"
if state_key := policy.metadata.get("state_key"):
    observation[state_key] = np.zeros(policy.metadata["state_dim"], np.float32)

result = policy.infer(observation)

result["actions"]   # (H, policy.action_dim) float32, unnormalized
result["timing"]    # model_ms / total_ms
policy.close()
```

`<path-to-model>` is a checkpoint directory (`model.safetensors`, `config.json`,
and that model's tokenizer/normalizer assets); none ships with this package.
Resize, tokenization, normalization, and the flow sampler all run inside `infer`
— pass raw frames.

### Serve it with OpenPI compatible websocket server

```bash
python python/apxinf/examples/openpi_server.py \
  --model-dir <path-to-model> --model-variant bf16 --port 8000 \
  --image-keys observation/image,observation/wrist_image \
  --state-key observation/state
```

An unmodified `openpi-client` connects to it:

```python
from openpi_client import websocket_client_policy

client = websocket_client_policy.WebsocketClientPolicy("127.0.0.1", 8000)
actions = client.infer(observation)["actions"]
```

## Performance

## Port a new model with an agent

`skills/model-port-workflow` drives the whole sequence.
Start with the [documentation index](doc/README.md) and
[current module responsibilities](doc/model-layer-architecture.md#current-module-names-and-responsibilities).
New VLA code separates Model forward computation, ModelRunner execution ownership,
and weights; reuse the existing native binding and policy registries. The
[integration guide](doc/adding-a-new-model.md#registration-and-public-integration)
identifies current contracts and family-specific option limits.

Install it once, from the repository root:

```bash
# Claude Code
mkdir -p .claude/skills && ln -s ../../skills/model-port-workflow .claude/skills/

# Codex
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills && ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/model-port-workflow" ~/.agents/skills/
```

Then invoke it with the model, the target, and the acceptance bar:

```
/model-port-workflow port GR00T N1.7 from <path-to-reference-implementation> to
ApxInf, Jetson Thor, BF16, parity against the reference within 1e-2
```

It works from the same guides a human would follow:
- [porting workflow](doc/porting-workflow.md),
- [adding a new model](doc/adding-a-new-model.md),
- [model-layer architecture](doc/model-layer-architecture.md),
- [adding new kernels](doc/adding-new-kernels.md).

## Build ApxInf

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd ApxInf
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install maturin
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/wheel maturin build --release --features cuda --auditwheel skip -m crates/apxinf-py/Cargo.toml
pip install --force-reinstall target/wheel/wheels/apxinf_py-*.whl
pip install -e "python/apxinf[serving]"
```

Activate a venv or conda env before installing. The `serving` extra adds msgpack/websockets.

`--features cuda` is a Cargo feature, not a CUDA installation: it compiles the
CUDA backend into the binding, and it is required — the PI0.5 runtime is only
registered on CUDA devices, as is WallOSS.

The build queries the visible GPU for its compute capability and compiles the
kernels for exactly that architecture, so build on the machine you deploy to;
cross-compiling fails unless `APXINF_CUDA_ARCH` names the target (`sm_87` Orin,
`sm_101` Thor-U, `sm_110` Thor).

Confirm the binding imports and reaches the GPU:

```bash
python -c 'import apxinf_py; print(apxinf_py.__version__)'
python scripts/bench_pi05.py --random-weights --model-variant bf16 --layer l1 --samples 5
```

Needs a Linux host with an NVIDIA driver and a CUDA toolkit plus a stable Rust
toolchain. If `nvcc --version` or `cargo --version` fails, set them up first:

- [NVIDIA build environment](#nvidia-build-environment)
- [Rust toolchain](#rust-toolchain)


## Using ApxInf from Python

Three public layers, each wrapping the one before. Pick the outermost one that
still leaves you the control you need.

### L1 — native ModelRunner

You own resize, tokenization, noise, and unnormalization; the model takes
already-resized frames and returns a **normalized-domain** chunk.

```python
from apxinf import ModelRunner

model_runner = ModelRunner.load("pi05", "<path-to-model>/model.safetensors", model_variant="bf16")

# rgb: uint8 [views, H, W, 3] at model_runner.image_size; tokens: uint32; noise: float32
actions = model_runner.infer_rgb(rgb, "nhwc", token_ids, noise)   # (H, action_dim)
model_runner.action_horizon, model_runner.num_views, model_runner.image_size
```

### L2 — policy

Adds the pre/post pipelines and reads the checkpoint's tokenizer and
`norm_stats`, so it takes a raw observation dict and returns deployable actions
— the [Run a policy](#run-a-policy-through-python-api) snippet. Beyond that call
it exposes the serving contract, the pipelines, and the layer boundary:

```python
policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained(
    "<path-to-model>",
    model_variant="bf16",
    action_dim=None,        # default: infer the model's full vector from checkpoint weights
)

policy.metadata             # model_type, action_horizon, image_keys, state_key, ...

result = policy.infer(observation)
result["normalized_actions"]  # what L1 returned, before trim + unnormalize
```

The pipelines are ordered named steps — `image_stack -> tokenize` in, `trim ->
unnormalize` out — and every mutation returns a new one, so a custom step drops
in as a value: `policy.input_pipeline.replace("tokenize", MyTokenizeStep())`.
See [the frontend README](python/apxinf/README.md).

### L3 — websocket server

Wraps an L2 policy in the OpenPI wire protocol. See
[OpenPI-compatible serving](#openpi-compatible-serving).

## OpenPI-compatible serving

The server speaks OpenPI's websocket protocol, so an existing `openpi-client`
robot stack connects without a code change — swap the endpoint and keep the
observation dict you already send.

```python
from apxinf import AutoPolicy
from apxinf.serving import WebsocketPolicyServer

policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained(
    "<path-to-model>",
    model_variant="bf16",
    image_keys=("observation/image", "observation/wrist_image"),
    state_key="observation/state",
)
WebsocketPolicyServer(policy, "0.0.0.0", 8000).serve_forever()
```

`image_keys=` / `state_key=` / `prompt_key=` say what your client sends. Omit
`image_keys` and the policy falls back to the model's own view-slot names
(`base_0_rgb`, ...), published as `apxinf.CANONICAL_IMAGE_KEYS` — a fallback,
not a contract. `state_key` has no fallback at all, because the two failures are
not alike: a wrong camera key raises on the first inference, a wrong state key is
silent, so a policy that reads state refuses to be built without one.

The server keeps the checkpoint's native action width unless the user supplies
`--action-dim`. It publishes the resolved wire contract in connect-time metadata
so the client can assert it rather than guess.


## Precisions

`--model-variant` selects the PI0.5 implementation; the serving command is otherwise
unchanged.

```bash
python scripts/pi05_openpi_websocket_server.py \
  --model-dir <path-to-model> --model-variant bf16 --port 8000 \
  --image-keys observation/image,observation/wrist_image \
  --state-key observation/state
```

```python
policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained("<path-to-model>", model_variant="bf16")
```

| Precision | Where | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `bf16` | every supported device; the default | the checkpoint alone |
| `fp8_static` | Thor only, where it is the fastest path — Orin has no FP8 Tensor Cores | per-tensor activation scales |
| `int8_dynamic` | W8A8, optimized for Orin (SM87) and Ada (SM89) | the checkpoint alone |

### FP8 calibration

Pass the calibration generated for the deployment data explicitly; when omitted,
ApxInf falls back to `<path-to-model>/calibration.json`:

```bash
python scripts/pi05_openpi_websocket_server.py \
  --model-dir <path-to-model> --model-variant fp8_static \
  --image-keys observation/image,observation/wrist_image \
  --state-key observation/state \
  --calibration <path-to-calibration.json> \
  --port 8000
```

```python
policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained(
    "<path-to-model>",
    model_variant="fp8_static",
    calibration="<path-to-calibration.json>",
)
```

If the checkpoint does not contain `calibration.json`, generate one from
representative Observations — a JSONL manifest, a directory of Observation NPZ
files captured wherever the environment already lives, or the native LIBERO10
simulator driven in this process:

```bash
python3 scripts/calibrate_pi05.py --model-dir <path-to-model> \
  --manifest <path-to-observations.jsonl>

python3 scripts/calibrate_pi05.py --model-dir <path-to-model> \
  --input-dir <path-to-observations>

python3 scripts/calibrate_pi05.py --model-dir <path-to-model> \
  --libero-suite libero_10
```

The NPZ form makes the calibration input a reviewable artifact rather than a side
effect of a rollout; `--libero-suite` drives MuJoCo here and needs the same
dependencies as [LIBERO evaluation](#libero-evaluation).

See [PI0.5 FP8 calibration](doc/pi05-fp8-calibration.md) for the Observation
format, native LIBERO sampling, and output options.


## LIBERO evaluation

### Get the checkpoint

The published accuracy is `pi05_libero_base`, π0.5 fine-tuned on LIBERO — an
arbitrary π0.5 checkpoint might not reproduce it.

```bash
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download lerobot/pi05_libero_base --local-dir <path-to-model>
curl -fL https://storage.googleapis.com/openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi05_libero/assets/physical-intelligence/libero/norm_stats.json \
  -o <path-to-model>/norm_stats.json
```

The `lerobot/pi05_libero_base` checkpoint lost its normalization statistics
during repository updates. To reproduce the officially reported performance,
download OpenPI's LIBERO `norm_stats.json` separately as shown above and pass it
explicitly with `--norm-stats`.

### Run

The rollout needs LIBERO and MuJoCo:

```bash
python -c 'from libero.libero import benchmark'
```

If that fails, install
[LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO) from source
(`pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .`, then `export
MUJOCO_GL=egl`, or `osmesa` if the machine has no EGL). Its `requirements.txt`
brings MuJoCo through robosuite and pins `numpy==1.22.4`, which predates Python
3.11 and so builds from source on a newer interpreter; `--no-deps` skips it.

`--backend websocket` additionally needs `openpi-client`, from an
[openpi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi) checkout
(`pip install -e packages/openpi-client`).

`scripts/eval_libero.py` builds the policy in-process — no server involved:

```bash
python scripts/eval_libero.py --backend in-process --model-dir <path-to-model> \
  --norm-stats <path-to-model>/norm_stats.json \
  --precision bf16 --action-horizon 10 \
  --suite libero_10 --tasks all --trials-per-task 50 \
  --results-jsonl <out-dir>/results.jsonl --summary-json <out-dir>/summary.json
```

That is the published protocol: all 10 LIBERO-10 tasks x 50 episodes at seed 7
(the default), 500 episodes in total.

### Options

- `--suite` picks the task suite, `--tasks` a comma list within it, and
  `--trials-per-task` the episode count; a smoke run is
  `--tasks 0 --trials-per-task 1`.
- The model flags — `--model-type`, `--norm-stats`, `--action-horizon`, `--action-dim`,
  `--discrete-state`, FP8 `--calibration` — belong to `--backend in-process`
  alone.
- `--backend websocket --host <h> --port <p>` evaluates a running
  [server](#openpi-compatible-serving) instead, on this machine or another. The
  model flags belong to the server there, and `--precision` only asserts what
  the server reports, so a mismatch fails at connect instead of skewing a run.
  Pass `--norm-stats <path-to-model>/norm_stats.json` to
  `scripts/pi05_openpi_websocket_server.py` when serving this checkpoint.
- `--image-keys` / `--state-key` override the LIBERO wire keys. Both backends
  read them, so an in-process and a websocket run stay comparable.
- Runs are resumable: completed task/trial rows in the JSONL ledger are skipped,
  and the summary reports success rate alongside per-segment latency.


## π0-FAST

π0-FAST is a **token** VLA: instead of a continuous flow-matching head it
autoregresses FAST discrete action tokens, and the policy layer detokenizes them
(BPE then an orthonormal DCT) before unnormalizing. L1 therefore has its own
entry point — the raw tokens — and L2 turns them into actions:

```python
from apxinf import AutoPolicy

policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained("<path-to-model>", precision="bf16")

# L1: raw FAST action tokens, uint32 [max_action_tokens]
tokens = policy.model.infer_action_tokens_rgb(rgb, "nhwc", token_ids)

# L2: tokens -> detokenized, unnormalized actions
result = policy.infer(observation)        # observation: 2 cameras + state + prompt
result["action_tokens"]                   # the ids behind result["actions"]
result["normalized_actions"]              # before unnormalization
```

At L1 the runtime embeds exactly the ids it is handed, so `token_ids` must end
with the PaliGemma BOS that triggers decoding — LeRobot concatenates it after the
prompt before prefill, and `Pi0FastPolicy` appends it for you. Without that
trailing BOS the model continues the prompt text (a caption) instead of emitting
the `Action: …|` stream.

The prompt is assembled from the task and the *discretized* state, so the state
is required and its width is a checkpoint property — `policy.metadata["state_dim"]`
(8 for LIBERO's `eef_pos + eef_axis_angle + gripper_qpos`). The two tokenizers are
read from the assets the checkpoint names (`text_tokenizer_name`,
`action_tokenizer_name`) and resolved offline: pass a local path with
`tokenizer_path`/`fast_tokenizer_path`, or set `APXINF_PALIGEMMA_TOKENIZER` /
`APXINF_FAST_TOKENIZER`, or let the local Hugging Face cache answer.

### Run

```bash
# the native binding then the frontend, as in "Build ApxInf" - no extra of its own
pip install --force-reinstall target/wheel/wheels/apxinf_py-*.whl
pip install -e python/apxinf
huggingface-cli download lerobot/pi0fast-libero-v044 --local-dir <path-to-model>

python scripts/eval_libero.py --backend in-process --model-dir <path-to-model> \
  --precision bf16 \
  --suite libero_10 --tasks all --trials-per-task 50 \
  --results-jsonl <out-dir>/results.jsonl --summary-json <out-dir>/summary.json
```

Unlike PI0.5 this checkpoint carries its own normalization statistics, so
`--norm-stats` is neither needed nor accepted (its use is an error, not a silent
no-op).

## Benchmark

`scripts/bench_pi05.py` times the concentric serving shells so a regression can
be attributed to the engine, the processors, or the transport.

```bash
python scripts/bench_pi05.py --model-dir <path-to-model> --model-variant bf16 --layer l1,l2
```

- `--layer` selects any subset of `l1` (bare model), `l2` (full policy), `l3`
  (websocket round trip). L3 attaches to a running server and needs no local
  weights.
- `--model-dir` runs a real checkpoint at its native horizon; `--random-weights`
  runs the engine with no checkpoint on disk, and the shape knobs (`--views`,
  `--image-size`, `--action-horizon`, `--num-flow-steps`, `--token-count`)
  select the synthetic workload.
- `--calibration` is FP8-only and synthetic-only; a checkpoint reads
  `calibration.json` from its own directory.
- `--action-horizon` also applies to a checkpoint — the horizon is a sequence
  length, not a weight dimension — which is what makes a real checkpoint
  comparable to a synthetic run.
- `--warmup` / `--samples` set the sampling protocol (default 10 and 30);
  `--out` writes the report as JSON.

Any registered model type works: `AutoPolicy` dispatches on the checkpoint's
`config.json`, so the same command benchmarks the next model without a flag
change.

For one-step evaluation, please refer to `doc/run_warmstart_with_onestep.md`


## NVIDIA build environment

A complete CUDA toolkit is required: `nvcc`, CUDA headers and runtime, cuBLAS
and cuBLASLt development libraries, and NVTX (`libnvToolsExt` on Jetson,
`libnvtx3interop` on desktop CUDA). Also a C/C++ compiler, linker, `ar`, Git,
`pkg-config`, and Python 3. The CUDA kernels, CUTLASS, and FlashAttention
sources are vendored — no external checkout needed.

Install the driver and toolkit through the JetPack, DRIVE OS, or CUDA
distribution for the machine, then check `nvcc --version`. If CUDA does not live
at `/usr/local/cuda`, point `CUDA_PATH` at it.

| Device | Architecture | Validated toolkit |
|---|---:|---:|
| Jetson AGX Thor | `sm_110` | CUDA 13.0 |
| Thor-U | `sm_101` | CUDA 12.8 |
| Jetson AGX Orin | `sm_87` | CUDA 12.6, 13.2 |
| RTX 4090 | `sm_89` | CUDA 12.8 |


## Rust toolchain

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustup default stable
```

Built with Rust 1.95 and 1.96; no minimum supported version is declared.
