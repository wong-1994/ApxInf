# apxinf (Python frontend)

Python-first (NumPy/Pillow plus native Rust tokenizers) processor library + the **L2** policy
layer for the ApxInf VLA runtime. The bare-model L1 inference binding lives in
the [`apxinf-py`](../../crates/apxinf-py) PyO3 crate; `apxinf` re-exports it as
`apxinf.ModelRunner` so you never import `apxinf_py` directly.

**Adding a model:** drop `apxinf/policies/impls/<name>.py` following `pi05.py`
(decorate the class with `@register_policy("<name>")`), then re-export it from
`apxinf/policies/impls/__init__.py`. `AutoPolicy` picks it up automatically.

## Layers

- **Processor steps** (`apxinf.processors`) — each an independently-callable
  `ProcessorStep`: `ParseImage`, `ResizeWithPad`, `PromptTokenizer`,
  `Normalizer`/`Unnormalizer`, `GaussianNoise`, chained by `Pipeline`. The
  package remains importable without a GPU or native extension; built-in
  tokenization loads `apxinf-py` lazily when the tokenizer is constructed.
- **WallOSS processor** — its family-local policy reads `tokenizer.json`
  through `apxinf-py`. Pillow performs smart resize;
  the native runtime performs Qwen2.5-VL normalization and patchification in
  CUDA, while NumPy retains a compatible patch path for custom processors. Its
  legacy `.pth` normalizer sidecars are read by a restricted tensor-only loader,
  without importing Torch or Transformers.
- **L2 policies** (`apxinf.Pi05Policy`, `apxinf.WallossPolicy`, or
  `apxinf.AutoPolicy`) — own each model family's pre/post contract around a
  bare-model handle and return deployable actions from one
  `infer(obs_dict) -> {actions, timing, ...}` call. `import apxinf`
  stays CUDA-free; built-in tokenizer construction and model loading import
  `apxinf_py` lazily.

## Domains

L1 (the binding) returns **normalized-domain** actions; policies return
the **unnormalized-domain** chunk. `infer` also returns `normalized_actions`,
so the layering invariant `L2 minus unnormalize == L1` is directly checkable.

## Standalone steps

```python
from apxinf.processors import ResizeWithPad, PromptTokenizer, Unnormalizer

img224 = ResizeWithPad(224)(raw_hwc_uint8)
token_ids = PromptTokenizer("tokenizer.model")("pick up the block")
actions = Unnormalizer.from_norm_stats("model_dir", dims=7)(normalized[:, :7])
```

## Adding a processor implementation

Two layers of `ProcessorStep` live here, and they extend differently:

- **Natural-signature steps** (`resize` / `tokenize` / `normalize` / `noise`) —
  each `__call__` takes its natural input (an image, a prompt, an action array,
  nothing). This is where new *implementations* go.
- **dict→dict transforms** (`processors/transforms.py`: `ImageStack` /
  `Tokenize` / `SampleNoise` / `Trim` / `Unnormalize`) — thin adapters that read
  a few data-dict keys, **delegate to an injected natural step**, and write an
  output key. They define a *role* (which key they produce), not an
  implementation.

WallOSS also accepts a callable `processor=` in `WallossPolicy.from_pretrained`.
It must return `(patches_f32, token_ids_u32, action_mask_f32)` using the model's
canonical shapes. The built-in processor remains the checkpoint-compatible
default and sends resized RGB to runtimes that advertise that capability, so
normalization and patchification run in the CUDA graph. This seam lets Python
applications customize observation handling without forking the Rust runtime.

**A new implementation should not touch `transforms.py`.** The swap seam is
dependency injection at pipeline-assembly time, not the transform classes:

```python
# subclass the natural contract (same signature, e.g. noise: () -> [H, D])
class BetaNoise(ProcessorStep): ...

# inject it — the transform (SampleNoise) is unchanged
input_pipeline, output_pipeline = Pi05Policy.default_pipelines(model, ..., noise=BetaNoise(H, D))
# or insert/swap it on an existing pipeline (copy-on-write):
input_pipeline = input_pipeline.insert_after(
    "tokenize", ("sample_noise", SampleNoise(BetaNoise(H, D)))
)
input_pipeline = input_pipeline.override("sample_noise", ...)   # tweak PARAMS only
```

The default pipeline has no `sample_noise` step: omitting external noise lets
the runtime generate it directly in the stable device buffer.

**Organize growth by implementation family, not by transform key.** When a
category earns a second implementation, promote its file to a package
(`noise.py → noise/`, with `__init__.py` re-exporting so
`from apxinf.processors import GaussianNoise` keeps working) — do **not** create
directories named after the data-dict keys (`rgb` / `token_ids` / `actions`).
Keys are a runtime contract, not a taxonomy: `normalize` alone serves two roles
(action `Unnormalize` **and** state normalization inside `Tokenize`), `Trim` has
no natural-step backing at all, and `ImageStack` wraps a whole `parse → resize`
sub-pipeline — so keys map neither 1:1 to files nor to categories.

**Config-driven selection**, if it is ever needed (e.g. `config.json` naming
`noise.type = "beta"`), should add a per-category registry mirroring
`apxinf.policies.registry` (`@register_noise("gaussian")` / `get_noise(...)`) —
not a key-named directory tree. Like the policy registry, add it only once a
real second implementation and a real need to select it exist; do not abstract
ahead of the second example.

## Policy

The PR-era `compute_variant` keyword and `--compute-variant` CLI flag are replaced
by `model_variant` and `--model-variant`; callers must update.

PI0.5 selects its implementation with `model_variant`: `auto`, `bf16`,
`fp8_static` or `int8_dynamic`. Static FP8 uses calibrated activation scales;
dynamic INT8 uses per-row activation scales and fixed per-channel weight scales.
`ModelRunner.model_variant` and PI0.5 policy metadata report the resolved
implementation, including when loading with `auto`.
The previous PI0.5 `precision` keyword is no longer accepted. Other model families
retain their own loading options until migrated.

Two entry points, both returning something that satisfies the `Policy` contract:

```python
from apxinf import AutoPolicy, Pi05Policy

# Generic: read config.json's model type and dispatch to the right class.
policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained("model_dir", model_variant="bf16", action_dim=7)

# Concrete: when you need model-specific knobs.
policy = Pi05Policy.from_pretrained("model_dir", model_variant="bf16", action_dim=7)

result = policy.infer({
    "observation/image": base_rgb,
    "observation/wrist_image": wrist_rgb,
    "observation/state": state,   # currently dropped (see below)
    "prompt": "pick up the block",
})
result["actions"]   # unnormalized float32 [horizon, action_dim]
result["timing"]    # {"model_ms": ..., "total_ms": ...}
```

For bare-model (L1) use, the binding is reachable as `apxinf.ModelRunner`:

```python
from apxinf import ModelRunner
model = ModelRunner.load("pi05", "model.safetensors", model_variant="bf16")
model.infer_rgb(rgb_u8, "nhwc", token_ids)          # internal device sampling
model.infer_rgb(rgb_u8, "nhwc", token_ids, noise)   # exact external noise
```

Any default step is replaceable at construction (`image_pipeline=`,
`tokenizer=`, `unnormalizer=`, `noise=`) for a custom high-performance
implementation.

## Policy contract

`apxinf.Policy` is a structural `typing.Protocol` every L2 policy satisfies:
`metadata`, `action_dim`, `action_horizon`, `infer(obs, noise=None) -> dict`, `close()`.
`infer` guarantees the `actions` and `timing` keys across all policies. It's the
anchor point for future models (a `GrootPolicy` satisfies the same contract),
for `AutoPolicy` dispatch, and for a future lerobot adaptor — no inheritance
required, structural typing only.

## lerobot interop

Not here: wrapping a `Policy` in lerobot's surface means translating *its*
robot/camera/dataset-feature vocabulary, which is a property of the robot stack
rather than of the checkpoint. An adaptor built one layer up wraps any `Policy`
satisfying the contract above, so a lerobot user keeps their robot, cameras,
feature plumbing and action dispatch and swaps only the policy.

Two notes that are the engine's to make, because they are about what this package
does and does not run:

**Whose pre/post runs: ours.** apxinf's `Pipeline` does resize, tokenize, and
unnormalize; the model runtime generates prior noise unless it is supplied
explicitly. lerobot splits the same work differently (resize and prior noise live
*inside* its policy; normalize lives in its processor pipeline), so pipelines from
its `make_pre_post_processors` are **not** interchangeable with ours — feeding
their output here would drop resize and double-normalize.

**No training path.** Fine-tuning / PEFT through this engine is structurally
impossible: there is no autograd behind `infer`. Train elsewhere, export, serve
here.

## Camera views

pi05 has `num_views` camera slots (3 for the LIBERO checkpoint), but a task may
supply fewer (LIBERO uses base + one wrist). The policy zero-fills the absent
slots — the openpi convention for masked/missing cameras — so 2 cameras drive a
3-slot model. Passing more keys than slots is an error; disable padding with
`pad_missing_views=False`.

## State injection

PI0.5 supports state injection with `discrete_state=True`. The policy normalizes
raw state using the checkpoint-selected transform, discretizes it and builds the
`Task/State/Action` prompt. This requires an explicit `state_key`; robot presets
may supply both settings. Direct policy construction leaves injection off by
default. Choose normalization dtype according to the checkpoint/reference:
rounding near a bin edge can change the prompt tokens.

## Built-in family contracts

Tokenizer execution is native, while prompt/state orchestration and action
postprocessing remain Python. The shared lifecycle and ownership rules are in
[Model Lifecycle and Contracts](../../doc/model-lifecycle.md).

| Contract | PI0.5 | WallOSS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State encoding | optional 256-bin encoding, preserving underflow bin `-1`; normalization dtype is significant | required configured bins, clipping to range and selecting active state dimensions |
| Token sequence | SentencePiece BOS; without state, append a separately encoded newline | HF added tokens, camera labels, image placeholder expansion and action tokens |
| Image/model input | configured resized RGB views and token IDs | built-in resized RGB with two `18x18` grids; custom processor returns canonical patches, token IDs and action mask |
| Output | trimmed, checkpoint-transformed actions plus normalized model actions | trimmed, inverse-normalized actions plus normalized model actions |
| Customization | replaceable Python input/output pipelines | explicit `processor=` callable; custom processing does not implicitly select native RGB |

For WallOSS, each image placeholder expands to
`product(grid_thw) / merge_size^2` tokens. Camera order, labels and grid metadata
must agree. A one-dimensional DOF mask broadcasts to
`[action_horizon, action_dim]`; the active-state mask supplies its default.
For PI0.5, separately encoding the trailing newline is part of the non-state
sequence contract; concatenating it to the task before encoding is not an
established equivalent. Both models return checkpoint-domain policy actions;
external robot units, actuator ordering and command encoding remain adapter
responsibilities. These differences must survive a future native prompt builder.

## Tests

```bash
pip install -e '.[test]'
pytest tests/        # offline; tokenizer + real-model tests skip without a checkpoint
```

The `test` extra holds reference implementations, never runtime dependencies: the
native tokenizer differential tests need the Python `sentencepiece` reference and
a SentencePiece model (`APXINF_TOKENIZER` or `APXINF_PI05_MODEL_DIR`). Everything
else is checked against the definition or against itself — the π0-FAST inverse DCT
is compared with the textbook term-by-term sum, not with scipy. The real-model
layering test needs a CUDA `apxinf_py` build plus `APXINF_PI05_MODEL_DIR`.
