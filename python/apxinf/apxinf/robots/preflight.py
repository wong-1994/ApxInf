"""Startup checks: does this checkpoint actually match the preset serving it?

A checkpoint directory and a ``--robot`` preset are two independent claims about
the same robot, and nothing forces them to agree. Serve a Unitree G1 checkpoint
with a LIBERO ``norm_stats.json`` and ``--action-dim 7`` and every layer accepts
it: the weights load, the tokenizer runs, the unnormalizer finds ``q01``/``q99``
of *some* width, the server publishes an action shape, and the robot receives 7
plausible-looking floats per step that mean nothing. The only visible symptom is
that the model "got worse" — which reads as a model problem, gets escalated as a
model problem, and is not one.

That exact combination shipped. This module is the check that would have refused
it, phrased as a list of :class:`Finding` s rather than an exception, so a caller
can report all of them at once instead of fixing them one crash at a time.

**What is checked here** is what can be read from the checkpoint *directory* with
the standard library: which layout it is, where its ``norm_stats.json`` actually
lives, that file's widths and keys, and the tokenizer. Nothing loads a weight and
nothing imports torch or the CUDA binding, so these checks run before the
expensive part of startup — and on a laptop. The richer cross-check against the
preset's own wire keys and delta convention lives in
``scripts/openpi_metadata_to_apxinf.py``, which calls this module and adds to it.

**What is deliberately not checked here** is anything already enforced elsewhere:
``len(image_keys) == model.num_views`` raises inside
:class:`~apxinf.policies.impls.pi05.Pi05Policy`, and the unnormalizer's own width
rules live in :mod:`apxinf.processors.normalize`. Duplicating them would mean two
places to keep in step.
