"""Robot presets: the wire contract of one embodiment, as a named table entry.

OpenPI keeps this information in a Python registry of ``TrainConfig``s: which
``DataTransformFn`` pair runs, and therefore which **wire keys** the client must
send. ``serve_policy.py --policy.config pi05_UnitreeG1_...`` selects an entry;
the client cannot negotiate it and must match by hand.

This module is the same idea with the same shape, so switching embodiments is a
launch flag on both sides rather than a code edit on ours:

    openpi:  serve_policy.py --policy.config pi05_UnitreeG1_groundwire
    apxinf:  pi05_openpi_websocket_server.py --robot unitree_g1

**Why a table and not a default.** ``Pi05Policy``'s ``_DEFAULT_IMAGE_KEYS`` is
LIBERO's wire contract. As *the* default it silently applied to every checkpoint,
so a G1 checkpoint served without extra arguments ran LIBERO's keys, dropped
state, and skipped the G1 delta→absolute and 32→16 steps — every symptom of a
"model accuracy problem" with nothing in the logs. A preset makes the embodiment
an explicit, named choice.

**Why slot names.** ``image_keys`` is order-significant: entry ``i`` is stacked
into model view slot ``i``, which the checkpoint trained as openpi's
``base_0_rgb`` / ``left_wrist_0_rgb`` / ``right_wrist_0_rgb``. A tuple written in
the wrong order still stacks, still has the right shape, and silently feeds the
wrong camera to each slot. Pairing every wire key with the slot it fills makes
that order reviewable instead of positional.

**Naming rule: ``<arm>_<convention>``.** The arm alone does not determine the
contract — LIBERO and DROID are both Franka Panda, yet LIBERO sends
``observation/image`` with a 7-dim EEF-delta action while DROID sends
``observation/exterior_image_1_left`` with a different action space. So a preset
is named for the arm *and* the dataset convention whose keys it implements:
``franka_libero``, not ``libero`` (a benchmark, not a robot) and not ``franka``
(ambiguous). Single-embodiment robots that own their convention need no suffix —
``unitree_g1``.
