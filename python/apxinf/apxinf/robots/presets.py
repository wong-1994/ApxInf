"""Robot presets: the wire contract of one embodiment, as a named table entry.

OpenPI keeps this information in a Python registry of ``TrainConfig``s: which
``DataTransformFn`` pair runs, and therefore which **wire keys** the client must
send. ``serve_policy.py --policy.config pi05_UnitreeG1_...`` selects an entry;
the client cannot negotiate it and must match by hand.

This module is the same idea with the same shape, so switching embodiments is a
launch flag on both sides rather than a code edit on ours:

    openpi:  serve_policy.py --policy.config pi05_UnitreeG1_groundwire
    apxinf:  pi05_openpi_websocket_server.py --robot unitree_g1

**Why a table and not a default.** ``Pi05Policy`` used to default ``image_keys``
to ``("observation/image", "observation/wrist_image")`` — LIBERO's wire contract,
living in the model layer as *the* default for every checkpoint. A G1 checkpoint
served without extra arguments therefore ran LIBERO's keys, dropped state, and
skipped the G1 delta→absolute and 32→16 steps — every symptom of a "model
accuracy problem" with nothing in the logs. The policy now names its cameras
after its own :data:`~apxinf.policies.base.VIEW_SLOTS` when the caller names
none, so no dataset's convention can pass for a model default; a preset makes the
embodiment an explicit, named choice.

**Why slot names.** ``image_keys`` is order-significant: entry ``i`` is stacked
into model view slot ``i``, which the checkpoint trained as openpi's
``base_0_rgb`` / ``left_wrist_0_rgb`` / ``right_wrist_0_rgb``. A tuple written in
the wrong order still stacks, still has the right shape, and silently feeds the
wrong camera to each slot. Pairing every wire key with the slot it fills makes
that order reviewable instead of positional. The slot vocabulary itself is a
*model* fact, so it is imported from :mod:`apxinf.policies.base` rather than
restated here.

**Naming rule: ``<arm>_<convention>``.** The arm alone does not determine the
contract — LIBERO and DROID are both Franka Panda, yet LIBERO sends
``observation/image`` with a 7-dim EEF-delta action while DROID sends
``observation/exterior_image_1_left`` with a different action space. So a preset
is named for the arm *and* the dataset convention whose keys it implements:
``franka_libero``, not ``libero`` (a benchmark, not a robot) and not ``franka``
(ambiguous). Single-embodiment robots that own their convention need no suffix —
``unitree_g1``.

**Two halves, one flag.** That naming rule is an admission, so the dataclasses
follow it: an :class:`Embodiment` is the body (camera count, action width, which
pre/post steps its actions need) and a
:class:`~apxinf.conventions.Convention` is a dataset's recording dialect (the
wire keys, and whether state was recorded into the prompt). Neither knows the
other; they vary independently, which is the point — the same Franka under
DROID's keys is a second convention, not a second body, and re-recording the G1
changes no :class:`Embodiment` field. Conventions live in
:mod:`apxinf.conventions` rather than here, because a dialect is not a robot's
property: this module imports them, never the reverse.

A :class:`RobotPreset` names one *pairing*, and only the pairing is deployable.
``--robot`` stays a single flag over that registry rather than becoming
``--robot`` + ``--convention``: separate flags would let an operator spell a
combination nobody ever recorded, and a body served under a convention it was not
recorded on is exactly the silent mismatch this whole mechanism exists to
prevent. The pairing is validated when the module loads — a convention naming
three cameras cannot be attached to a two-camera body.

**Registering from outside.** :func:`register_robot_preset` adds an entry from
another package, so a third-party robot does not have to patch this file to
become ``--robot <name>``.
