"""ApxInf Python frontend.

Public modules:

* :mod:`apxinf.processors` — pure-numpy pre/post-processing *steps* (resize,
  tokenize, normalize, noise) plus a :class:`~apxinf.processors.Pipeline`
  container. Each step is independently instantiable and callable on its natural
  input, with no GPU / no Rust dependency, so it unit-tests offline. Every step
  here is determined by the **checkpoint**; steps determined by a robot body live
  outside this package.
* **policies** — the **L2** layer (:mod:`apxinf.policies`).
  :class:`~apxinf.policies.impls.pi05.Pi05Policy` composes a pre pipeline + a
  bare-model handle (L1) + a post pipeline into a single
  ``infer(obs_dict, noise=None) -> {actions, timing, ...}`` call.
  :class:`~apxinf.policies.auto.AutoPolicy` dispatches a checkpoint to its concrete
  policy by ``config.json`` model type; :class:`~apxinf.policies.base.Policy` is
  the structural contract they all satisfy.
  :class:`~apxinf.policies.base.ComposablePolicy` is the capability an *outer*
  layer needs to wrap its own steps around a policy's chain.
* :mod:`apxinf.checkpoints` — what a checkpoint directory declares about itself:
  layout detection, metadata, norm stats, and
  :func:`~apxinf.checkpoints.inspect_checkpoint`, which reports whether a
  directory is self-consistent and servable.
* **bindings** — :class:`ModelRunner` re-exports the ``apxinf_py`` PyO3 handle (L1
  bare-model inference; an internal L0 patches path exists but is private). It is
  the single public surface; you never import ``apxinf_py`` directly.
* :mod:`apxinf.serving` — the websocket policy server (a thin, model-agnostic
  transport shell over any :class:`Policy`, with an openpi-compatible wire).
  Imported only on demand (``from apxinf.serving import WebsocketPolicyServer``)
  so its ``msgpack`` / ``websockets`` deps stay out of offline processor use.

This package holds **no dataset's wire contract and no robot's body**. What a
client calls its cameras, how many joints an arm has, which action components are
deltas — none of that is determined by the weights, so a caller names its own
keys through ``image_keys=`` / ``state_key=`` / ``prompt_key=`` and wraps its own
body steps through :meth:`~apxinf.policies.base.ComposablePolicy.with_adapter`.
:data:`CANONICAL_IMAGE_KEYS` / :data:`CANONICAL_STATE_KEY` /
:data:`CANONICAL_PROMPT_KEY` name the neutral fallback for callers that want to
address it without restating string literals. A robot/dataset/simulator
adaptation layer builds on top of these seams; none of it lives here.

``import apxinf`` never touches CUDA: only ``apxinf.ModelRunner`` (accessed lazily) and a
policy's ``from_pretrained`` pull in the ``apxinf_py`` binding.
