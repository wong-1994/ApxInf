"""pi05 L2 policy: raw observation dict + prompt -> unnormalized action chunk.

:class:`Pi05Policy` mirrors openpi's policy shape — ``input_pipeline`` (pre) →
``model`` → ``output_pipeline`` (post) — where each pipeline is a
:class:`~apxinf.processors.Pipeline` whose flowing value is a **data dict** and
each step is a ``dict -> dict`` :class:`~apxinf.processors.ProcessorStep` (see
:mod:`apxinf.processors.transforms`). The model inference itself is *not* a
pipeline step: it is the policy's own middle step, called directly on the
``apxinf_py`` bare-model handle, exactly as openpi calls ``sample_actions``
between its input and output transforms.

This makes the whole pre/post chain reorderable, insertable, and replaceable
through the ordinary ``Pipeline`` machinery — a custom high-performance resize or
tokenizer drops in with ``input_pipeline.replace(...)`` / ``insert_after(...)``
without forking the framework. Those verbs address steps *by name*, so they are
for callers who know this chain. A caller who only needs to run steps **around**
it — a robot adapter — uses :meth:`Pi05Policy.with_adapter`
(:class:`~apxinf.policies.base.ComposablePolicy`) instead and stays ignorant of
what the chain contains.

Domain contract: the model returns a **normalized-domain** action; this policy
returns the **unnormalized-domain** chunk. The intermediate normalized action is
also returned (``normalized_actions``) so the layering invariant
``L2 minus unnormalize == L1`` can be checked directly.

**State injection (opt-in, off by default):** state is dropped by default so the
numerics match today's serving link. Enable it with ``discrete_state=True``: the
raw state is first mapped to ``[-1, 1]`` by a ``state_normalizer`` (a
:class:`~apxinf.processors.Normalizer` over ``norm_stats["state"]`` by default),
then discretized into the prompt — matching openpi's "normalize then discretize"
order. This path does **not** assume the incoming state is already in ``[-1, 1]``.

**This module names no dataset's wire keys.** ``image_keys`` falls back to the
model's own :data:`~apxinf.policies.base.VIEW_SLOTS`, and ``state_key`` has no
fallback at all — it is required exactly when state is read and may stay ``None``
when state is dropped. ``("observation/image", "observation/wrist_image")`` and
``"observation/state"`` used to be the defaults here, which is LIBERO's dialect
applied to every checkpoint: a G1 checkpoint served bare ran LIBERO's contract
and looked like an accuracy problem. Wire keys belong to
:mod:`apxinf.conventions`; a robot preset pairs one with a body.

This module registers ``Pi05Policy`` under ``model_type="pi05"`` so
:class:`~apxinf.policies.auto.AutoPolicy` can dispatch to it.

        This is the from-disk convenience path: it loads the ``apxinf_py`` model
        (unless one is passed in), builds the SentencePiece tokenizer and the
        action quantiles from files under ``model_dir``, assembles the default
        pre/post chains via :meth:`default_pipelines`, and constructs the policy.
        Its many parameters are exactly the knobs for *building processors from
        disk* (``norm_key``/``action_dim``/``discrete_state``/``tokenizer_path``/
        ``state_norm_key``) — only this method knows ``model_dir``.

        ``action_dim`` trims the unnormalizer to the task's action width (e.g. 7
        for LIBERO); ``None`` keeps the full vector. ``unnormalizer`` supplies the
        quantile map directly instead of reading ``norm_stats`` from disk — for a
        shape/plumbing run on a stand-in checkpoint whose statistics belong to a
        different robot (pass a full-width identity), where reading the file would
        silently apply the wrong scale. It is mutually exclusive with
        ``action_dim``, since an injected map already fixes the width.
        ``action_horizon`` overrides
        the checkpoint's chunk length: ``None`` runs the native ``config.json``
        value, an explicit value outranks it (the horizon is a sequence length,
        not a weight dimension, so the same weights run at any horizon the config
        validator accepts). State injection is off by default; with
        ``discrete_state=True`` a state normalizer is built from
        ``norm_stats[state_norm_key]`` to map raw state to ``[-1, 1]`` before it is
        discretized into the prompt, and ``state_key`` becomes **required** —
        there is no dataset-neutral name to fall back to, and guessing one would
        drop proprioception silently.

        ``num_views`` loads the checkpoint for fewer cameras than it declares, for
        a deployment that has fewer. It must equal ``len(image_keys)``. This drops
        the trailing view slots at load time instead of zero-filling them per
        request, which is numerically equivalent to openpi's padding + masking
        (a masked view is excluded from attention, occupies no RoPE position, and
        the vision tower has no per-slot parameters) and skips their patch tokens.

        Unless ``tactics`` is explicitly supplied, CUDA deployments select the
        validated tactic database for their compute capability and precision.
        A checkpoint-local ``tactics.json`` takes precedence over source-tree
        defaults, so normal Python and serving callers share the same routing.

        For a **fully custom** pre/post chain, do not funnel it through here:
        build the parts yourself and use :meth:`default_pipelines` +
        :meth:`__init__` (or mutate ``policy.input_pipeline`` after construction).
