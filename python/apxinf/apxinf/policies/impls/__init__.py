"""Concrete per-model L2 policies - the volatile part of the policy layer.

One module per model family (:mod:`~apxinf.policies.impls.pi05`,
:mod:`~apxinf.policies.impls.pi0fast`, :mod:`~apxinf.policies.impls.qwen_drive`,
:mod:`~apxinf.policies.impls.walloss`, and future ``groot``, ...). The stable
machinery — contracts, registry, dispatch — lives one level up in
:mod:`apxinf.policies`; only this package grows as models are added.

Importing this package imports every model module for its side effect: each
registers its class under a ``model_type`` via
:func:`~apxinf.policies.registry.register_policy`, so
:class:`~apxinf.policies.auto.AutoPolicy` can dispatch. **To add a new model:**
create ``apxinf/policies/impls/<name>.py`` following ``pi05.py`` (decorate the
class with ``@register_policy("<name>")``), then add its import + re-export here.

Nothing here imports ``apxinf_py``; policy classes load the CUDA binding lazily
inside ``from_pretrained``, so importing the package stays offline-friendly.
