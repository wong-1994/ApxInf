"""The contracts shared across the frontend: :class:`Policy` and :class:`BareModel`.

Both are structural :class:`typing.Protocol` types — nothing has to inherit
them; any object of the right shape satisfies them. They are the stable anchor
points other layers code against:

* :class:`BareModel` — the model-side contract (L1 bare inference) a policy
  consumes, i.e. the subset of a ``apxinf_py.Model`` handle it relies on.
* :class:`Policy` — the L2 contract (``obs dict -> result dict``) every
  model-specific policy satisfies. Downstream consumers (the websocket server, the
  :class:`~apxinf.policies.auto.AutoPolicy` registry, a lerobot adaptor) code
  against this, never a concrete class.
* :class:`ComposablePolicy` — the narrow extra capability a policy needs before
  an *outer* layer (a robot adapter) can wrap steps around its chain. Optional:
  a policy is a perfectly good :class:`Policy` without it.
* :data:`VIEW_SLOTS` — the camera slot names a checkpoint's weights consume, in
  order. Model vocabulary, kept here so a policy and a robot preset can both
  name a slot without importing each other.

The ``Policy.infer`` result is a plain dict. Two keys are guaranteed across all
policies: ``actions`` (deployable, unnormalized-domain ``float32``
``[action_horizon, action_dim]``) and ``timing`` (at least ``model_ms`` and
``total_ms``). Policies may add model-specific keys (``Pi05Policy`` also returns
``normalized_actions`` / ``token_ids`` / ``noise``); consumers must not rely on
anything beyond the two guaranteed ones.

#: These are **model** vocabulary, not wire keys and not a dataset's convention.
#: A checkpoint's ``num_views`` says how many of these it was trained on; the
#: *order* is baked into the weights, and nothing here ever crosses the network.
#: They live in this module rather than in a robot preset or in ``pi05.py``
#: because both sides need to agree on them without either importing the other:
#: a policy uses them to name the cameras it wants when the caller does not, and
#: a robot preset uses them to say which slot each of its wire keys fills.
#:
#: The pi05 family shares this vocabulary. A model with a different camera layout
#: declares its own rather than stretching this tuple.
