"""dict→dict processor steps for a policy's pre/post :class:`Pipeline`.

openpi composes a policy as ``inputs transforms → model → outputs transforms``,
where each transform is a ``dict -> dict`` function over a shared data dict. This
module provides that transform layer for pi05, reusing the existing single-value
steps (:class:`~apxinf.processors.resize.ResizeWithPad`,
:class:`~apxinf.processors.tokenize.PromptTokenizer`, etc.) unchanged — each class
here is a thin ``ProcessorStep`` that reads a few keys from the data dict,
delegates to a wrapped natural-signature step, and writes its output key back.

Because a policy's pre/post chain is just a :class:`~apxinf.processors.base.Pipeline`
whose flowing value is the data dict, these steps compose, reorder, and override
through the same ``Pipeline`` machinery as the image sub-chain.

**Data-dict key contract**

* pre (input) chain — reads ``observation`` / ``prompt``; writes ``rgb`` (uint8
  NHWC), ``token_ids`` (uint32), ``noise``.
* post (output) chain — reads ``normalized_actions``; writes ``trimmed`` then
  ``actions`` (unnormalized float32).

Each step returns the *same* dict, updated in place — a pre/post chain is a linear
single-owner flow, so there is no aliasing hazard, and later steps see earlier
steps' keys.

    the caller must supply precisely the cameras the checkpoint expects (absent
    cameras are simply not sent, never zero-filled).

    ``image_keys`` order is what binds a camera to a model view slot: entry ``i``
    becomes ``rgb[i]``, which the checkpoint trained as its slot ``i`` (openpi's
    ``base_0_rgb`` / ``left_wrist_0_rgb`` / ``right_wrist_0_rgb``). A wrong order
    stacks cleanly and silently feeds the wrong camera to each slot, so build the
