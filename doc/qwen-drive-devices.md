# Qwen-Drive on more than one device

One model implementation, three boards -- Jetson AGX Orin (sm_87), Jetson AGX
Thor (sm_110) and the RTX 4090 (sm_89). This is what to know before changing
anything that behaves differently on one of them: where each kind of
per-device decision belongs, and what the constants currently are.

## The fixed workload

Four public VQA scenes from WOD_E2E, batch 1, BF16, exactly 64 generated
tokens, one warmup and three measured requests per scene, warm median. Each
scene is three camera views (front, front-left, front-right) of four frames at
0.5 s spacing — twelve images — plus a 16-point history, ego velocity and
acceleration, and the driving and navigation commands. The four differ in ego
state: stationary, just-braked, 2.67 m/s, 6.99 m/s.

`control/verify_perf_orin.py` runs it; `control/verify_gpu_orin.py` is the
four-mode correctness gate over the same inputs.

## Where the per-device decisions live

Three layers, and a change belongs to exactly one of them.

**Compile time — which kernels exist.** `build_support/cuda_arch.rs` selects
the architecture, and the family predicates in `build.rs`
(`is_fa2_sm80_family`, `is_fa2_bf16_arch`, `is_cutlass_sm100_family`,
`is_cutlass_sm89_family`) turn that into `cargo:rustc-cfg=apxinf_*`. Adding a
board that shares a family with one already supported is usually one arm of one
of those predicates — #60 added GB10 that way, and the head-64 and head-256
FlashAttention-2 dispatch adapters reached Thor the same way here.

**Run time — which compiled path runs, with what constants.**
`CudaDeviceCaps` carries the hardware facts and classifies the family;
`kernels/gdn_policy.rs` carries the policy that follows from them. The GDN
kernels take their tile widths, block width, recurrence split and tensor-core
form from that one table rather than deciding for themselves, and each field
has an environment override so a new board can be re-swept without a rebuild.

**Data — which tactic each shape uses.**
`configs/tuning/<vendor>/<family>-sm<N>/tactics.json`, resolved by
`TuningPaths::resolve_for_cuda`. Four stores ship: `rtx4090-sm89`, `orin-sm87`,
`thor-sm101`, `thor-sm110`. Recording one is a run of the autotuner, not a code
change.

A tactic is only valid for the libraries that measured it, and all three boards
were running a different toolkit from the one their store was recorded on, so
every record was rejected at load and the GEMMs quietly fell back to the
untuned heuristic. The resolver therefore prefers
`<family>-sm<N>/cuda<major>.<minor>-cublas<major>.<minor>/tactics.json` and uses
the unqualified file only when its header matches the running libraries — the
subdirectory is named by the same truncation the loader compares, so a store
found under it is one this toolkit can use in full. Nothing relocates: a board
running the toolkit its store was recorded on resolves to exactly the file it
resolved to before. A second toolkit now writes beside the first rather than
over it. See `doc/jetson-roofline.md` for what regenerating is worth — 12.6% on
Orin, 0.05% on Thor after the accuracy filter, nothing at all on the 4090.

## What the constants actually are

`GdnLaunchPolicy::defaults_for` is the whole table, and the point of collecting
it in one place is that not one of these values transfers between the two
families:

| | sm80 family | sm100 family |
|---|---:|---:|
| chunk-state tile | 8 | 4 |
| chunk-state block | 512 | 1024 |
| chunk-gemm tile | 8 | 4 |
| recurrence split | 1 | 4 |
| chunk-state scan | scalar fp32 | two BF16 terms on tensor cores |
| blocks per head in the scan | from the multiprocessor count | from the multiprocessor count |

The curves are not merely shifted, either: a chunk-state tile of 16 is 8% off
the optimum on Orin and 26% off on Thor, and a chunk-gemm tile of 32 -- which
was the sm80 default until the kernel's two products were fused -- is a 10%
regression rather than a mild one.

Every field has an environment override (`APXINF_GDN_*`, named in
`gdn_policy.rs`) so a new board can be re-swept without a rebuild. Re-sweep
after changing any of these kernels: the chunk-state block width has moved
twice already, and the chunk-gemm width once.

## When a measurement is needed

Three things decide correctness questions on this model, in this order, and the
four-mode gate is not one of them -- it reports scene 0's maximum trajectory
error, which on this checkpoint only ever takes the two adjacent BF16 output
ULPs 0.0403 and 0.0806, so it flips on changes that move nothing:

1. `cargo test -p apxinf-cuda gdn_ -- --nocapture` runs the fp64 operator
   oracles for the GDN kernels and the bit-exactness test for the value split.
   A kernel change that claims to preserve the arithmetic has to say so here.
2. `control/precision_probe.py` reports token agreement and error
   distributions over every scene of every runnable mode, which move
   continuously where the gate does not.
3. `control/verify_perf_orin.py` for speed, always as alternating A/B rounds on
   one machine.

A recorded store belongs to the toolkit that measured it, so it is committed
at the path that says so:

```
configs/tuning/nvidia/thor-sm110/tactics.json                       CUDA 13.0, 116 records
configs/tuning/nvidia/thor-sm110/cuda13.2-cublas13.4/tactics.json   CUDA 13.2,   7 records
```

Both boards work. The autotuner rewrites rather than merges, so recording on
13.2 into the unqualified file would have left a Thor on 13.0 with seven
records for a toolkit it is not running. An autotune report is an artifact,
not a deliverable -- the engine only ever appends to it -- so it does not
belong in a commit either.

Measurement evidence for the three boards -- rooflines, kernel tables, the
per-device sweeps behind the table above -- is kept out of the review diff
under `devlocal/qwen-drive/reports/` per `AGENTS.md`, along with the probes
that produced it and the two subsystems this revision does not reach: the
packed-weight GEMV and the perception scaffold.

One measurement note that costs hours if it is learned the hard way: on a
Jetson the same build measures several percent apart over an afternoon, and
6.29 s/scene at 14:20 became 6.75 s at 17:40 with nothing changed. Any
comparison has to be alternating rounds of both sides on one machine within
one run. Two numbers an hour apart are not a comparison.
