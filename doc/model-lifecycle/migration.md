# Model lifecycle refactor: staged rollout and documentation gates

Current integration rules: [module ownership and family support](../model-layer-architecture.md#current-module-names-and-responsibilities),
[registration procedure](../adding-a-new-model.md#registration-and-public-integration),
and [implemented PI0.5 preparation](lifecycle.md#implemented-pi05-preparation-contract).
Stage descriptions below retain the terminology of their recorded revisions;
use the naming follow-up and current guides for new code, not the earlier
Session/Network or runtime/executor layouts.

Status: PI0.5 Stage 2 is complete for the agreed refactor scope: runtime removal,
fixed-asset organization, model_variant naming and module encapsulation.
Session G qualifies final-source Thor performance after the earlier contention
window; Orin performance and final native checks retain their separately recorded
sources. Later model stages remain open.
Architecture and interface decisions live in [architecture.md](architecture.md)
and [lifecycle.md](lifecycle.md); this file owns rollout order and evidence tracking.
Current-source review baseline: upstream/main
`7baa69b281ef862e6afa32c476c58143d3964241`.

## Rollout principles

Use one model as a vertical pilot before extracting a shared framework. A stage
may span several small reviewable PRs; do not equate a stage with one large diff.
Each production change is qualified on its supported paths before migration moves
on. Final qualification consolidates evidence; it is not the first time GPU
correctness or performance is checked. Preserve public entry points unless a
reviewed compatibility change requires otherwise.

Do not begin with directory-wide executor renames, three new dtype trees, a
universal Network factory, a graph IR, or a new allocator. Do not combine a kernel
algorithm optimization with structural migration unless the separation is
impossible and the numerical/performance change is explicitly reviewed.

## Stage 1: contracts and reproducible baseline

Deliverables:

- Refresh the implementation worktree against the selected main revision before
  coding. Resolve newer changes explicitly; this documentation refresh does not
  claim the old refactor worktree already contains merged GR00T.
- Record current entry points, input contracts, preparation modes, request state,
  output residency, graph keys and memory ownership for PI0.5, WallOSS, GR00T,
  Llama and Qwen3-VL. Use the two specification documents as the starting point.
- Record a supported model/checkpoint/device/precision matrix. Agree numerical
  tolerances and performance budgets before changing code, not after regressions.
- Establish reusable raw-input, exact-latent and generation fixtures. Keep private
  checkpoints/datasets in place; record paths and revisions in devlocal evidence.
- Inventory consumers of existing weight/compute types before moving shared code.

Stage 2 may proceed in an isolated candidate while Stage 1 runs on Thor, as
requested. Keep baseline source and artifacts immutable; compare the candidate
against that baseline before accepting the slice. Prefer verified existing
operator libraries and verify source/flag/architecture identity before reuse.
If an object is missing or incompatible, record the exact gap and rebuild only
what is necessary; do not trigger a blanket operator rebuild with Rust changes.
Concurrent GPU loads invalidate formal latency comparisons.

Exit: baseline commands and results are reproducible on selected hardware; every
matrix cell is qualified, explicitly pending, or unsupported. Unavailable GPU
access blocks GPU qualification, not documentation or local structural work.
Current status: source merge and inventory complete; local checks recorded in
[Stage 1 baseline protocol](baseline.md). PI0.5 now passes the final Thor/Orin matrix and lifecycle
qualification. Other families, their target assets and deployment budgets remain
open in the broader Stage 1 inventory; this does not block the completed PI0.5 pilot.

## Stage 2: PI0.5 vertical pilot

Why PI0.5: it already attempts capture during explicit prepare, supports eager
fallback and checks tuning-generation validity. These provide a concrete starting
point for the target readiness contract without overlapping active GR00T work.

Deliverables:

- Separate fixed assets, Network/Blocks and Session ownership inside PI0.5.
  Begin with major vision/language/action computations, not a directory-wide rename.
- Use BF16 as the first evidence path while preserving FP8/W8A8 behavior. Verify
  every affected supported precision before shipping shared changes; broad weight
  and precision consolidation remains Stage 5.
- Preserve tuning-generation validity, generated/provided noise behavior, input
  compatibility and eager fallback while making their guarantees explicit.
- Implement explicit prepare readiness, captured-resource retention, output
  device/lifetime contracts, and request reset versus plan invalidation.
- Keep processor encode/decode context explicit in existing Policy helpers.
- Provide a native raw-input-to-output vertical path and regression evidence.

Exit: a compatible run performs no hidden capture/tuning; changed compatibility
enters explicit preparation; capture failure and cleanup obey policy. Exact-input
results and public action decoding meet declared tolerances and resource/latency
budgets. Network has no cache/serving logic; Session has no duplicate network body.

The slice A/B records below are historical; the exit checklist records current completion.

### Stage 2 slice A: BF16 computation ownership

The first candidate extracts 14 computation/diagnostic methods from
pi05/bf16_runtime.rs into pi05/network.rs. The BF16 runtime owns capture, input
updates and workspace lifetime and delegates eager/captured math to the same
Network. Captured objects retain an Arc to Network, keeping referenced weights
alive. Existing public methods and Bf16PrefixKvCache export remain compatible.

This slice deliberately leaves preparation semantics and FP8/W8A8 computation
unchanged. It is not the final precision-neutral Network or full Stage 2 result.
The current *_executor files remain the Block implementations until subsequent
semantic grouping is justified. Next slices address the VLA prepared-session
interface and remaining precision paths with their own validation.

Validation so far: CUDA-feature Rust typecheck including all examples passes on
macOS without linking CUDA; all 14 moved method bodies match baseline ignoring
formatting; family dependency check passes. Thor native AutoModel smoke passes
for baseline and candidate. All four two-view H10/H50 × T10/T21 cases show exact
baseline/candidate and eager/graph parity (max_abs=0, relative L2=0, cosine=1).
See [baseline evidence and limits](baseline.md#thor-bf16-slice-a-numerical-result-2026-09-15).
Performance and full matrix qualification remain open. No operator source changed.

### Stage 2 slice B: explicit PI0.5 Session preparation

Implemented: `session.rs` replaces `vla_runtime.rs`, with `Pi05Session` and a
compatible `Pi05VlaRuntime` alias. LoadedModel and VlaRuntime expose
prepare_with_policy, prepare_for and clear_prepared. PreparedInference reports
actual mode, fallback reason and invalidation. Eager/PreferGraph/RequireGraph
have distinct behavior; prepared run suppresses autotuning and rejects stale
plans for both eager and graph. Real-input tuning stays in preparation or the
legacy infer cache-miss path. Old implicit plans are released before replacement
tuning allocations. Explicitly held plans are not silently destroyed.

See [the callable lifecycle contract](lifecycle.md#implemented-pi05-preparation-contract)
for output aliasing and remaining limitations. Host-side tuning suppression is
scoped and unwind-safe; operator sources and build flags are unchanged.

Validation: 107 local CPU tests and CUDA-feature examples/tests typecheck pass;
macOS native CUDA test linking is unavailable. Thor passes three Session unit
tests and one tuning-guard test. Final public smoke `3884257` passes on BF16,
FP8 and W8A8: actual Eager/RequireGraph, populated cache eviction, invalid-spec
recovery, RNG and raw RGB paths. All seven fixed-input comparisons are exact
(four BF16, two FP8, one Thor W8A8). Library code is `f81d02d`; no CUDA operator
was compiled. See [slice B evidence](baseline.md#thor-session-slice-b-evidence-2026-09-15).
Orin, full online tuning/invalidation, forced native capture-failure cleanup,
resource/performance gates and remaining computation/Blocks work stay open.

### Stage 2 slice C: shared Network and native lifecycle recovery

Candidate `7937440` completes the PI0.5 computation split for BF16, static FP8
and W8A8. One statically dispatched Network owns the model schedule. Blocks own
precision backbones/layers and fixed weights; resource adapters retain workspace,
bindings and graph lifetime. Existing public methods and prefix cache exports
remain compatible. Activation scales move to fixed assets with a compatibility
re-export. Broad weight consolidation remains Stage 5.

Prepared plans now bind tuning-store identity as well as generation. The CUDA
backend provides one capture scope for PI0.5's three adapters; errors/unwind end
capture without instantiating a discarded graph. Native testing caught a stale
CUDA last-error slot after invalidated capture; cleanup now consumes known
capture errors so a later eager kernel check does not inherit them.

Thor native tests pass: two Network schedule tests, the strengthened error/unwind
capture test, three Session policy/cache tests, the tuning guard test, and the
explicitly enabled real-checkpoint failure/invalidation test. The latter covers
RequireGraph failure, PreferGraph eager recovery, replacement of a tactic store
at the same generation, suppressed tuning during repeated prepared execution,
re-capture and separately owned plan execution after dropping Session.
Local checks pass: 107 Rust CPU tests, CUDA-feature examples/tests typecheck,
family boundaries, formatting, and 182 Python tests (6 skips, 5 subtests).

### Stage 2 slice D: complete PI0.5 organization

The user extended this stage and explicitly allowed breaking low-level interfaces.
Candidate `883e55c` removes all runtime files, shares preparation and graph
ownership, moves construction/typed dispatch to load.rs, organizes fixed assets
under weights/, and exposes model_variant with bf16/fp8_static/int8_dynamic.
Network no longer imports any concrete Block variant. Repository Rust/Python
callers and diagnostic examples use the new interfaces. The architecture document
contains the full directory tree and migration table.

Local model CPU suite: 95 passed; benchmark argument tests: 2 passed. CUDA-feature
examples/tests typecheck and family-boundary checks passed. Python and calibration/evaluation tools: 233 passed,
6 environment skips and 5 subtests; local OpenPI roundtrip: 1 passed. Thor native
tokenizer/AutoPolicy: 7 passed, 0 skipped. Both devices passed native lifecycle
tests and public smokes. Orin completed eight performance profiles; its one
load-contaminated cell was independently rerun after the load subsided. Thor
performance was not qualified in that concurrent-load window. See the slice D
section of baseline.md for the historical evidence and Session G for final acceptance; slice C results retain their original source IDs.

### PI0.5 module encapsulation follow-up

Candidate `0f23048` groups execution, network and weights with enforced Interfaces.
Session fields and Network Blocks are private; load uses a constructor. LoadedCompute
moves into network/compute.rs; execution owns capture through a static generic
NetworkOperation supplied by execution, with no reverse module dependency. Resource
requirements are network-owned data; allocation stays in execution. Backend and CPU
math remain model-wide utilities. No numerical, packing or memory algorithm changed.
Both hosts passed native Network/Session/real-checkpoint lifecycle tests; Thor
passed all three public smokes and seven exact-output fixtures. Local CPU tests,
CUDA-feature typechecking and dependency guards passed. Details are tracked
separately in baseline.md. Session G additionally completes final-source Thor performance qualification
and closes the earlier contention blocker; historical samples remain recorded.

### PI0.5 naming follow-up

The naming-only follow-up uses `model_runner/Pi05ModelRunner` for lifecycle and
execution ownership, `model/Pi05Model<B>` for forward computation, and
`model/model.rs::ModelVariant` for precision dispatch. The Python binding is
`apxinf.ModelRunner` (the re-export of `apxinf_py.ModelRunner`); policy injection
and access use `model_runner`. Per-timestep modulation data is `StepModulation`.
The existing Rust `AutoModel` factory and `LoadedModel` result keep their names.
No wrapper, resource ownership or computation is added. See the
[canonical mapping and call relationships](architecture.md#canonical-names-and-pythonrust-relationship).
Rebuild the native extension and update Python callers together.

The candidate records above and GPU qualification below retain their historical
source names and revisions. Local verification of the rename includes 108 Rust
CPU tests, 242 Python tests, CUDA-feature typechecks and actual binding import.

The naming snapshot `a5f7e84ded89` (uncommitted changes on `830d188`) additionally
passes native Thor release builds, 8 model/runner/lifecycle/backend tests, all
three precision public smokes, and 7 fixed-input full-output comparisons.
All compared outputs match the preserved pre-rename outputs exactly (max_abs=0),
including eager/graph agreement. The rebuilt Python binding passes 7 real
policy/tokenizer/calibration tests and 7 GPU binding/L0-L1 tests with zero skips;
the official OpenPI websocket round-trip/health test also passes. The 23 cached
CUDA objects and kernel archive retain their audited hashes. No dedicated
performance qualification was performed in that snapshot; the separate run below
qualifies the committed naming change.
Evidence is under `devlocal/pi05-module-naming/thor-20260917/`; the implementation
report remains under `devlocal/pi05-module-naming/reports/`.

### Committed naming regression on Thor (2026-09-18)

2026-09-18 在 Thor 上重新构建命名提交 `f5fb3cd`（源码快照 `76cf08add247`），与保留的命名前 `0f23048` binary 做逐配置、交替顺序的对照。`0f23048..830d188` 仅有文档修改，因此该 binary 对应命名前 PR 的 runtime。复用相同 checkpoint、tactics、校准和固定 RGB/token/noise 输入；2/3 views × 10/21 tokens × BF16/FP8/INT8，共 12 组 H10，10 flow steps、10 次 graph warmup，每种延迟各采样 30 次。三视图沿用已有 fixture 的 wrist 图像复制规则，两侧输入相同。

12 组完整 eager/captured 输出与基线按位一致，workspace 的 capacity/used bytes 逐配置相同；另补 BF16/FP8 × T10/T21 的 4 组 H50，对照已保存的命名前完整输出，也全部按位一致。共 16 组 `max_abs=0`，每组 eager/graph 一致。Graph P50 变化 −0.38%～+0.48%，P95 −0.82%～+1.66%；包含输入更新的 graph P50 变化 −0.39%～+0.31%。本次样本未观察到明显性能退化。

每个进程运行前采样的 GPU utilization 均为 0%；1,622 个运行期遥测样本中，GPU 上仅有已知常驻服务和本次 benchmark，未发现新增并行 GPU 工作进程。保留全部 28 次进程执行的结果，没有剔除或替换样本。此处测量稳态 graph 与输入更新加 graph 延迟，不包含模型加载、capture、Python policy 开销，也不代表机器人闭环成功率。P95 来自 30 次采样，记录观察值，不将其当成部署 SLO。

| int8_dynamic | 3 / 10 | 136.522 → 136.669 | +0.11% | +0.32% | +0.01% |

Evidence: `devlocal/pi05-module-naming/thor-20260918/` contains the frozen source manifest, build log, binary and asset SHA-256, all commands, full outputs, telemetry and the final audit. The native build uses the same 23 audited CUDA objects; no operator source or binary changes.

### Stage 2 exit checklist (pre-naming qualification record)

| Requirement | Current result |
| --- | --- |
| All three compute variants separated from capture/cache | One Network, variant Blocks, shared prepare/CapturedGraph; no runtime adapters |
| Explicit preparation policy and actual readiness | Implemented; final three-precision Thor public smoke passed |
| No hidden capture/autotune in compatible prepared run | Native suppression and store invalidation tests passed on both hosts; final 0f23048 native link and Network/Session/real-checkpoint lifecycle tests passed on both |
| Request input/RNG rebinding versus plan eviction | Passed final native retained-plan/cache and RNG checks |
| Native failure cleanup and invalidation lifecycle coverage | Passed, including recovery through actual model execution |
| Processor/action decoding context | Python regression suite and real-checkpoint AutoPolicy layering/tokenizer tests passed without native-test skips |
| Exact-input and latency/resource comparison | Seven Thor exact-input fixtures passed; resource retention recorded. Orin eight-profile performance qualified in slice D; final-source Thor eight-profile comparison qualified in Session G |
| Orin | BF16/dynamic-INT8 H50 public smoke and eight-profile matrix passed; final 0f23048 native link and Network/Session/real-checkpoint lifecycle tests passed |

The user selected Thor as the primary Stage 2 acceptance target and Orin as the
last supplementary target. Report same-profile baseline latency and resource
deltas; no new percentage or absolute memory budget has been approved. A measured
comparison must not be relabeled as an agreed deployment SLO. Baseline/candidate
sources and asset identities remain pinned; known resident GPU services are
recorded rather than stopped. Final evidence belongs in [baseline.md](baseline.md).

## Stage 3: WallOSS; extract proven common mechanisms

Deliverables:

- Adopt the shared `model_variant` selection contract with model-owned values;
  validate naming and construction with PI0.5 and WallOSS before generalizing the
  common loader representation. See [compute selection](architecture.md#compute-implementation-selection-agreed-target).

- Use WallOSS as the second implementation to test which PI0.5 mechanisms are
  actually shared, rather than exporting PI0.5-specific assumptions as a framework.
- Make first-run initialization/capture an explicit preparation transition;
  retain or explicitly expose vision and latent-source compatibility conditions.
- Preserve dynamic FP8 behavior; do not impose PI0.5 static-calibration assumptions.
- Extract only mechanisms demonstrated by both migrated callers: capture cleanup,
  readiness reporting, bounded caching or resource retention. Keep model-specific
  layouts and semantic graph keys local.
- Keep Policy imports and generic binding entry points usable. Shared-contract
  changes must remain compatible with unmigrated GR00T through existing interfaces
  or a narrow migration adapter; do not silently change its behavior.

Exit: PI0.5 and WallOSS follow the same phase guarantees with explicit
model-specific payloads and graph topology. Test shape/mode changes, repeated
requests, noise/reset, fallback and memory-budget replacement on affected targets.
No broad cross-model backbone extraction is required for this stage.

## Deferred GR00T migration: independent development window

GR00T has concurrent feature development. Do not modify its Network, weights,
executor or capture path as part of the initial PI0.5/WallOSS migration. Its richer
inputs and resource ownership remain design constraints, not a reason to block
progress or to invent a universal contract in advance.

After an appropriate development window is agreed, re-audit the then-current
GR00T implementation and migrate it in separate PRs using the contracts validated
by PI0.5 and WallOSS. Preserve its existing precision-parameterized computation,
private backbone and request-local decode context. Do not assume today's file
layout or graph behavior will still apply.

This work does not block Stages 4 and 5 for other models. Stage 6 may qualify the
migrated subset, but must retain compatible legacy paths and mark GR00T pending;
framework-wide completion and removal of GR00T compatibility code require its
migration and affected GPU qualification to finish.

## Stage 4: LLM and VLM execution lifecycle

Deliverables:

- Preserve the shared native sampling/EOS generation driver and VLM prefill hook.
- Separate reusable KV storage/graphs from request valid length, positions and
  sampler state. New generation reset must not unnecessarily discard graph plans.
- Represent Llama prewarm and Qwen3-VL bucket capture through explicit preparation
  transitions. Prepare predictable decode ranges; preserve active state when
  extending an unforeseen range mid-generation.
- Document tokenizer/template and VLM input-processing ownership. Reuse existing
  tokenizer code; do not mandate a new Processor wrapper for already encoded input.
- Keep text generation and action inference interfaces distinct; reuse lifecycle
  mechanisms only where their contracts genuinely match.

Exit: multi-token and multimodal prefill/decode correctness, reset, EOS/limits,
streaming/cancellation and bucket transitions pass. Measure preparation, TTFT and
TPOT separately; no per-token Python control or new per-layer dynamic dispatch.

## Stage 5: precision and weight consolidation

Deliverables:

- Consolidate duplicate model weight trees and checkpoint mapping where structure
  matches; retain independent precision storage/scales/layouts where required.
- Group specialized compute beneath semantic blocks, e.g. blocks/action/fp8.rs.
  Do not create complete parallel networks under blocks/<dtype>/.
- Move matrix representations/packing to shared code only after multiple maintained
  callers demonstrate a compatible contract; kernel weight views stay backend-owned.
- Keep model-specific quantization choices in construction and scales/calibration
  site mapping explicit. Preserve mixed precision and fused quantization paths.
- Put maintained independent reference paths in a dedicated parity/benchmark
  harness. Temporary probes remain in devlocal, not alternate production Networks.

Exit: a supported precision can be selected without copying Network or lifecycle
logic. Check every affected precision with its checkpoint/calibration assets;
measure fusion, conversion overhead, memory and latency. Do not replace production
specialization with a universal optional-method trait solely to reduce lines.
Small Block moves needed by earlier stages are allowed; broad consolidation waits
until resource ownership and lifecycle have been exercised.

## Stage 6: end-to-end qualification and retirement

Deliverables:

- Consolidate supported-device/precision evidence; explicitly identify gaps.
- Check public callers, raw processing, device output, repeated requests, resource
  eviction, cancellation/error cleanup and model unload.
- Remove obsolete executor/runtime wrappers and duplicate production paths only
  after their callers and supported behaviors have migrated.
- Update current architecture references, model-port instructions, examples and
  API documentation. Mark which target contracts are implemented per model.
- Review locality: processor change, FFN fusion, backbone replacement, topology
  change and graph policy each have a predictable owner.

Exit: supported matrix passes agreed budgets, deprecated paths have a deliberate
compatibility decision, and maintained docs describe shipped behavior. File-count
or LOC reduction alone is not an acceptance metric.

## Documentation and review protocol

Each code PR changing a seam must update its relevant documentation in that same
PR. A separate documentation follow-up is not the default completion criterion.

| Changed subject | Source of truth to update |
| --- | --- |
| Ownership, Network/Block cut, dtype layout | architecture.md plus affected module rustdoc |
| prepare/run/reset, graph validity, output lifetime | lifecycle.md plus public/interface docs |
| Stage progress and supported evidence | This file's tracker; private evidence linked by reproducible location/revision |
| Current implementation guidance | ../model-layer-architecture.md and related maintained model guide |
| New model implementation checklist | ../../skills/model-port-workflow/SKILL.md and ../adding-a-new-model.md |
| User-visible behavior | Binding/facade documentation and examples |

The port skill now links the callable PI0.5 preparation contract and requires
family-specific evidence before declaring support. Preserve native GPU verification
requirements and distinguish implemented guarantees from the broader target.

Every implementation review includes:

1. Before/after ownership and any changed interface guarantee.
2. Current and target status, including compatibility or migration adapters.
3. Affected model/device/precision matrix and actual validation evidence.
4. First-use versus steady-state latency and relevant memory evidence.
5. Updated diagrams/rustdoc and no contradictory old-current descriptions.
6. Declared exceptions with rationale, owner/location and removal condition.

Keep invariants next to their code as well as in this specification: a prepared
plan's retained resources, output overwrite rules and Block physical layouts must
be discoverable without rereading conversation history. Do not copy long prose
into every file; link to the maintained contract and document local exceptions.

## Implementation tracker

Implementation and validation are tracked separately. No stage may be marked done
solely because the documentation or a CPU build passes.
