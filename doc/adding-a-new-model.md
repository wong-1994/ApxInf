# Adding a New Model to ApxInf

Use this guide after the reference model runs and its semantics are understood.
Follow [the porting workflow](porting-workflow.md) for evidence and acceptance,
[Model Lifecycle and Contracts](model-lifecycle.md) for stages and data contracts,
[the model-layer architecture](model-layer-architecture.md) for ownership and
dependencies, [Model Execution Wiring](model-execution-wiring.md) for composing
the maintained device path, and [the kernel guide](adding-new-kernels.md) for
genuine backend gaps. For a VLA, the *body* side of deployment — which
observation keys a client sends, how state is routed, how a named robot fixes
them together — is not needed to land a model here. A policy registered in
`apxinf.policies` is servable on its own, with the caller naming its own wire
keys.

## Start with a separate model directory

Every model implementation starts in its own directory:

```text
crates/apxinf-model/src/<model>/
```

Do not add the new architecture to `llama/`, `qwen3vl/`, or `pi05/`, even when
most code looks similar. Register the new directory from `lib.rs` and
`builtin.rs`; keep model detection in the existing registry/`AutoModel` path.

The first correct implementation should be self-contained. Copying substantial
code from the closest model is preferable to inventing a shared abstraction
before the second implementation exposes the real common boundary. Preserve
provenance when copying and rename model-specific concepts immediately.

Model-family directories are private architecture modules. Follow the
[dependency matrix](model-layer-architecture.md#per-model-isolation): inspect
and copy from a close implementation when useful, but keep the new product code
independent of other families. Run
`scripts/check_model_family_boundaries.sh` before review.

## Choose the runtime contract

### LLM and VLM

Autoregressive text models and vision-language models implement `LlmTrait`.
VLMs use `LlmInput` and override `prefill` for processor output, image-token
placement, multimodal positions, or other model-specific input semantics. They
reuse the shared token generation and sampling pipeline.

A small model commonly starts with:

```text
<model>/
  mod.rs
  config.rs
  weights.rs
  general.rs
```

Add files such as `vision.rs`, `vision_weights.rs`, or `decode_graph.rs` only
when the architecture requires them.

### VLA

VLA models implement `VlaRuntime`; they do not use the categorical token
generation loop. Their public contract is an observation-to-action inference
path with model-specific state, image, language, noise, schedule, and action
semantics.

PI0.5 is the maintained VLA structural reference. Use the
[module responsibility table](model-layer-architecture.md#current-module-names-and-responsibilities)
to assign ownership; this is its current layout, not a required number of files:

```text
pi05/
  mod.rs                 registration and deliberate exports
  config.rs / load.rs     config validation, variant selection, construction
  backend.rs             safe CUDA imports and type aliases
  math.rs                CPU helpers/reference semantics
  model/
    mod.rs               Pi05Model<B>: shared forward computation and flow schedule
    model.rs           ModelVariant: loaded precision-specific dispatch
    blocks/              layer/backbone implementation and resource requirements
    calibration.rs       model-specific diagnostic traversal
  model_runner/
    runner.rs            Pi05ModelRunner: VlaRuntime, input/RNG binding, plan cache
    prepare.rs           workspace allocation, warmup, capture and resource lifetime
  weights/               host mapping, packing, device weights, calibration scales
```

Create the new model's own directory and equivalent responsibilities. Do not
place its state encoder, action decoder, denoising schedule, embodiment logic,
or workspace inside `pi05/`. Inspect or copy PI0.5's model/Blocks and runner
structure when semantics fit; use `<Family>Model` and `<Family>ModelRunner` for
those roles. Preserve static precision specialization and keep one owner of
forward order. A family with one implementation needs neither `ModelVariant`
nor a generic Blocks abstraction merely to resemble PI0.5.

Choose the model input seam explicitly. The policy or application adapter owns
raw observation-container decoding, robot field and camera mapping, resize when
it is outside the declared model input representation, and experimental or
user-defined transforms. Policy semantics also stay outside the low-level
model: prompt and token construction, state/action normalization, action-mask
construction, and final action postprocessing.

The Rust runtime may accept either already canonical patch tensors or a
declared intermediate representation such as resized RGB `u8`. When
`VlaContract` advertises resized RGB support, checkpoint-fixed model tensor
canonicalization after that seam may belong to the Rust/CUDA runtime. Examples
include pixel normalization, temporal duplication, patchification, merge
ordering, layout conversion, and dtype conversion. These operations may be
prepared and CUDA-graph captured with the model computation. RGB support does not
make the low-level model responsible for arbitrary image containers, robot
observation dictionaries, prompt construction, or action unnormalization.

## Implement by responsibility

### Configuration

Parse the reference checkpoint configuration without forcing it into a
Llama-shaped shared config. Validate dimensions and architecture invariants at
load time. Defaults are acceptable only when the reference format defines the
same defaults.

### Weights

Map checkpoint keys explicitly. Record every transpose, reshape, concatenation,
packing operation, tied weight, and precision conversion. Hugging Face linear
weights commonly require `[out, in]` to `[in, out]` transposition, while
higher-rank convolutional weights require semantics-aware flattening.

Keep source weights, device weights, and precision-specific packed weights as
separate concepts when their lifecycles differ. Perform stable transformations
once during load, not in every inference.

### Model mathematics

Express the architecture as model-level composition of safe backend operators.
The model owns layer ordering, residual structure, attention layout, schedules,
and fusion selection. The backend owns device management and individual kernel
APIs; it never imports model types.

Use `backend.rs` as the model directory's CUDA seam when the implementation
needs concrete CUDA facilities. Portable operations use `dyn Backend`; a
specialized fast path may recover a concrete backend for capabilities that do
not belong on the portable trait. Trait is the floor; concrete types are the
ceiling.

Do not begin coverage discovery from `dyn Backend` alone. First inspect the
closest maintained model/Blocks implementation at the requested precision and the safe interfaces
under `apxinf_cuda::kernels`, especially fused normalization/residual,
QKV/RoPE/cache, attention, activation, and GEMM paths. Complete the execution
ledger from [Model Execution Wiring](model-execution-wiring.md) before treating
an operation as missing.

### Execution and preparation

Separate model computation from execution state. A model runner owns or retains
the model/weights, caches, workspaces, CUDA graphs and prepared profiles. A
prepared object must bind every shape or condition that changes allocation,
dispatch, or captured execution.

Preparation queries model/Blocks requirements, allocates stable resources,
and warms up the real model computation until native plans/tactics are stable
before capture. Configuration validation
alone is not preparation. Keep a CPU implementation inside a layer only as a
named correctness scaffold with an exit criterion. For an accelerator target,
replace it through an existing safe device path or `adding-new-kernels.md`
before completion; a repeated host escape is unfinished implementation rather
than ordinary best-effort optimization debt.

For VLA models, include state shape, image/grid structure, masks, action horizon,
action width, embodiment/category selection, and stochastic input shape where
they affect execution.

Keep request values distinct from plan compatibility. Current `InferenceSpec`
contains token count and image layout only; validate additional family invariants
in the runner or its profile key. Implement `PreparedInference::spec` and `run`;
declare the actual `status`. Implement `prepare_with_policy`, `prepare_for` and
`clear_prepared` when adopting the explicit preparation contract. Their defaults
are unsupported, not successful readiness. Verify mode/fallback reporting,
incompatible inputs, tuning-store replacement/generation, retained-plan lifetime,
and output overwrite behavior through native calls. The
[PI0.5 contract](model-lifecycle/lifecycle.md#implemented-pi05-preparation-contract)
is the executable reference; new-family support needs its own evidence.

### Registration and public integration

Complete these steps in the new family's own code and the existing registries:

1. Export the family module from `crates/apxinf-model/src/lib.rs`. Implement a
   `registry::ModelFactory` loader and wire its registration through
   `builtin::register_builtin_models`, with the correct feature gate and names.
   `AutoModel::load_model` resolves `LoadOptions.model_name` or checkpoint
   metadata; test both explicit selection and the supported detection path.
2. For LLM/VLM, return `LoadedModel::text(Box<dyn LlmTrait>)` and exercise shared
   generation. For VLA, implement `VlaRuntime` on the family runner and return
   `LoadedModel::Vla(Box::new(runner))`. Required methods include `contract`,
   `infer`, `prepare` and `infer_host_f32`; add preparation/calibration support
   deliberately instead of inheriting unsupported defaults unknowingly.
3. Declare the VLA input/output shape and RGB capability in `VlaContract`.
   Use `VlaRequest` for observation, provided latent or RNG key, and applicable
   metadata. Keep family config parsing in the loader. Check the
   [current option limits](model-layer-architecture.md#current-coverage-and-port-decisions)
   before adopting `model_variant` or binding config overrides.
4. Reuse the generic native `ModelRunner` binding. Add a
   `python/apxinf/apxinf/policies/impls/<family>.py` policy implementing the
   policy contract, register it with `register_policy`, and import it from
   `policies/__init__.py`. `AutoPolicy` must discover it by supported metadata
   or explicit `model_type`. Implement family input/output pipelines and
   `model_runner` injection; a new Python network or native binding class is
   unnecessary unless the existing public tensor contract cannot express it.
5. Test the complete chain below with real inputs. Rebuild the extension
   together with Python when the binding changes. Ensure checkpoint validation
   and server/policy selection support the new family; a private benchmark
   executable alone is not public integration.

```text
AutoPolicy → <Family>Policy → apxinf.ModelRunner (= apxinf_py.ModelRunner)
  → Rust AutoModel → registry loader → LoadedModel::Vla(<Family>ModelRunner)
  → <Family>Model / Blocks → safe backend operations
```

AutoPolicy and AutoModel are construction entry points, not per-request layers.
Policy `infer` preprocesses, calls the existing binding and decodes the result.
Keep robot adaptation, prompt, state/action normalization and output context at
that boundary. Checkpoint-fixed conversion after the declared RGB/tensor input
seam remains in the native model computation. See the
[current ownership table](model-layer-architecture.md#current-module-names-and-responsibilities).

## Add static-FP8 calibration

Use `apxinf.calibration.CalibrationRunner` for representative-data activation
calibration. The runner is model-neutral: it iterates public Observations,
aggregates statistics, validates coverage, creates scales, and emits the
manifest. Do not add a model branch to the runner or copy those operations into
a model command.

The family policy/calibration integration publishes its **actual FP8 execution plan** as stable
`QuantizedOperator` values. The default plan captures the input of every
quantized `linear` or `gemm` operator. It deliberately does not scan for every
module whose class or name happens to contain `Linear`; BF16 operators and
operators absent from the FP8 execution path do not require a scale.

A conventional model needs only a family name:

```python
spec = QuantizationSpec(model_family="new_model")
plan = spec.plan_for(policy.fp8_execution_plan())
```

Keep the model quantization specification thin. Use its overrides only for
real execution exceptions:

- `excluded_outputs` keeps declared outputs/layers in BF16;
- `shared_scales` maps multiple FP8 consumers to one capture-site scale;
- `custom_captures` declares a fused/custom operator's stable site and
  statistic;
- `default_statistic` changes the conventional sites from `absmax` when the
  quantization algorithm requires it.

Every quantized operator whose kind is not a conventional `linear` or `gemm`
must have a `custom_captures` entry. Planning fails when the override is absent;
an exceptional FP8 consumer must never disappear from coverage silently. Shared
sites must also declare one consistent statistic across all consumers.

Supported statistics are `absmax` and an explicit `percentile:P` with
`0 < P <= 100`. The model-side collector must calculate the statistic declared
for each site; the common runner retains and aggregates scalar records rather
than full activations. Add another statistic only with its aggregation and
runtime-consumption contract.

Capture-site names are artifact compatibility identifiers. Derive them from
logical model structure (for example `blocks.3.qkv.input`), never object IDs,
GPU addresses, hook order, or transient module paths. Renaming a stable site is
a calibration-schema migration.

`Fp8ExecutionPlan` and `QuantizationSpec` are Python calibration contracts;
they are not methods supplied by Rust `VlaRuntime`. The current Rust hooks are
`calibration_plan` and `calibration_amax`, both unsupported by default. Adapt
native observations into the Python plan in the family policy, as needed.

The policy implements the public `collect_calibration(observation,
context)` seam. It owns normal preprocessing and model-specific deterministic
inputs. A dataset adapter may translate an external record with
`adapt_records`, but it must return only the same public Observation accepted by
inference; it must not resize images, tokenize, normalize, generate noise, or
construct hidden tensors.

Before writing a manifest, validation requires every planned capture site to be
observed, rejects unknown observations, and rejects any generated scale without
an FP8 consumer. A custom site missing from execution therefore fails closed.
Dynamic-activation FP8 plans are classified as calibration-free: the runner
does not iterate the dataset and returns no static profile.

Override the defaults only when the quantized model implementation proves they are wrong:
fused operators need explicit capture boundaries, excluded BF16 layers consume
no FP8 scale, tied kernels may share one scale, and algorithms beyond static
per-tensor FP8 may require different statistics. Tests should exercise the
public Observation-to-manifest seam and consumer map, not collector
registration, hooks, or pointers.

PI0.5's pre-existing schema serializes only its native runtime-validated site
list. `CalibrationPlan.runtime_validated_sites` is the compatibility adapter for
that legacy contract; do not use it for a newly integrated model. New schemas
must serialize and test the consumer map generated from `Fp8ExecutionPlan`.

## YAGNI and refactoring

Apply YAGNI when any of these is true:

- only one maintained model needs the behavior;
- the apparent commonality is based on names rather than identical semantics;
- a second model is still experimental or its shapes and lifecycle are unknown;
- the proposed abstraction would add optional fields, family branches, or a
  configuration language for hypothetical users;
- copying keeps failures local and makes reference comparison easier.

In those cases, keep the implementation in the model directory. Duplication is
an explicit temporary design choice, not an invitation to hide it in the
backend.

Consider refactoring only when:

- at least two maintained models contain the same stable semantics;
- both implementations have independent correctness evidence;
- the shared dependency direction is model → model-neutral helper/backend;
- the extracted API has fewer concepts than either caller and needs no
  model-family switch;
- changes to one copy repeatedly require the identical change in the other.

Extract the smallest proven seam. Good candidates are pure tensor
transformations, checkpoint utilities with identical formats, or genuinely
model-neutral operators. Schedules, layer topology, workspace layouts, and
precision dispatch normally remain model-specific until repeated evidence says
otherwise.

## Kernel decisions

Match repeated model sequences to existing fused safe interfaces first, then
compose device primitives and layouts. A missing dtype, layout, shape, mask, or
semantic variant may require backend work, but the new API must be
model-neutral. Follow [Adding New Kernels](adding-new-kernels.md) and return to
the original model references for operator replay.

## Verification

Verify progressively:

1. configuration and checkpoint identity;
2. every weight transformation;
3. representative operator and layer checkpoints;
4. full deterministic output against the reference;
5. registered Rust loading path;
6. Python policy or serving path when in scope;
7. requested device and precision combinations;
8. latency and memory, reported separately from correctness.

Temporary capture and replay programs belong in the
[private port workspace](porting-workflow.md#private-port-workspace). Commit only
maintained product tests or examples whose purpose remains after the port is
complete.

## Completion criteria

Apply the [accelerator acceptance contract](model-execution-wiring.md#accelerator-port-acceptance)
when completing a new GPU port. The model has its own directory, uses the correct runtime contract, respects the
model/backend boundary, loads through the maintained registry, passes declared
numerical tolerances through the public path, has no accelerator hot-path host
escapes, verifies the required
prepared/static/captured execution, reports functional and optimization status
separately, reports unsupported cases clearly, and introduces no speculative
shared abstraction. Explicit performance release gates remain mandatory;
otherwise optimization is best effort.
A concrete operator/capture blocker is unfinished port work, not completion.
Update the family's capability documentation and the shared registry/interface
documentation in the same change; historical performance or another family's
prepared-plan tests do not establish support for the new family.
