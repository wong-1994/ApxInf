# PI0.5 FP8 calibration

Static FP8 needs representative activation scales in
`<model-dir>/calibration.json`. The calibration input uses the same public
Observation fields as inference; do not provide preprocessed tensors such as
`rgb`, `token_ids`, or `noise`.

## Observation manifest

The portable input is a JSONL file with one Observation per line. Image values
are paths relative to the manifest, or absolute paths. State is optional unless
the checkpoint's input configuration requires it.

```json
{"observation/image":"frames/000-base.png","observation/wrist_image":"frames/000-wrist.png","prompt":"pick up the block","observation/state":[0.1,0.2,0.3]}
{"observation/image":"frames/001-base.png","observation/wrist_image":"frames/001-wrist.png","prompt":"open the drawer","observation/state":[0.2,0.1,0.4]}
```

Generate the calibration file:

```bash
python3 scripts/calibrate_pi05.py \
  --model-dir <path-to-model> \
  --manifest <path-to-observations.jsonl>
```

By default this writes `<path-to-model>/calibration.json`. Use `--output` for
another location. Existing files are not overwritten unless `--force` is
passed.

Choose observations that represent deployment cameras, prompts, robot state,
lighting, scenes, and object poses. Every observation must contain exactly the
camera views expected by the checkpoint.

## Native LIBERO task observations

For the PI0.5 LIBERO checkpoint, generate a calibration file from observations
rendered by the actual LIBERO10 task suite:

```bash
python3 scripts/calibrate_pi05.py \
  --model-dir <path-to-model> \
  --libero-suite libero_10
```

This path uses LIBERO's BDDL tasks, language instructions, initial states, and
off-screen simulator cameras. It applies the same camera orientation, resize,
and robot-state conversion as `scripts/eval_libero.py`. Sampling is
deterministic and task-balanced. By default it captures one settled initial
state from every task; `--samples N` selects more initial states while retaining
balanced task coverage.

This command needs the same LIBERO and MuJoCo dependencies as the repository's
LIBERO evaluation command. For another simulator or deployment source, export
its public Observations through the manifest interface instead.

## Loading the calibration file

`AutoPolicy` automatically uses `<model-dir>/calibration.json`:

```python
policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained("<path-to-model>", precision="fp8")
```

Pass `calibration=` only when the calibration file is stored elsewhere:

```python
policy = AutoPolicy.from_pretrained(
    "<path-to-model>",
    precision="fp8",
    calibration="/path/to/calibration.json",
)
```

At FP8 startup, ApxInf reads the checkpoint shards to compare their SHA-256
identity with the calibration file. This can add startup time on slower storage.
An identity mismatch emits a warning and continues; malformed calibration files,
missing or invalid scales, and incompatible execution plans still fail because
the runtime cannot use them safely.

`tactics.json` is optional. If it is absent, the runtime warns and continues
with compatible kernel fallbacks; calibration is unaffected, though performance
may be lower than with tuned tactics.

Calibration files using an older schema are not migrated automatically.
Regenerate `calibration.json` with the ApxInf version being deployed.

Run `python3 scripts/calibrate_pi05.py --help` for checkpoint-specific input
overrides and reproducibility options.
