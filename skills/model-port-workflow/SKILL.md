name: model-port-workflow
description: Port a reference LLM, VLM, or VLA model into ApxInf with private evidence, model-layer isolation, kernel-gap handling, and end-to-end verification. Use when adding a model family, migrating a checkpoint/runtime, assessing operator coverage, or preparing a model-port review.

# Model Port Workflow

## Required reading

Read these repository documents before changing code:

1. [`doc/porting-workflow.md`](../../doc/porting-workflow.md) for the complete
   evidence and acceptance sequence.
2. [`doc/adding-a-new-model.md`](../../doc/adding-a-new-model.md) before creating
   or changing model-layer code. Follow its separate-directory and YAGNI rules.
3. [`doc/model-layer-architecture.md`](../../doc/model-layer-architecture.md)
   when deciding ownership, dependencies, runtime seams, or refactoring.
4. [`doc/model-execution-wiring.md`](../../doc/model-execution-wiring.md) before
   implementing an executor or deciding that optimized coverage is missing.
5. [`doc/adding-new-kernels.md`](../../doc/adding-new-kernels.md) whenever
   operator, dtype, layout, shape, or hardware coverage is missing.

Read each selected document completely. Treat them as instructions, not
background material.

## Workflow

1. Fix the reference revision, checkpoint identity, target, precision,
   representative inputs, tolerances, performance goals, and public API.
   Completion: every requested tuple and acceptance threshold is explicit.
2. Run the reference privately and capture deterministic inputs, outputs, and
   diagnostic tensors. Completion: the reference loads and repeated captures
   are attributable to the same source, environment, weights, and stochastic
   inputs.
3. Inventory semantics and weight transformations. Completion: every required
   computation is understood independently of its framework operator name.
4. Create an execution ledger from reference semantics through safe CUDA calls.
   Inspect maintained optimized executors and fused interfaces before the
   portable backend trait. Account for tensor lifetime, reusable KV/state,
   workspace, host traffic, and graph eligibility. Completion: every hot-path
   row has a device implementation, a named correctness scaffold, or a concrete
   blocker.
5. Classify fused and primitive coverage. If a real gap exists, follow
   `adding-new-kernels.md`, then replay the returned implementation against the
   original references. A CPU layer implementation is only a named correctness
   scaffold and must be reported as performance debt.
6. Create `crates/apxinf-model/src/<model>/`. Start with a self-contained
   implementation; copy a close model when useful and defer shared extraction
   until repeated maintained implementations prove the seam.
7. Integrate through the appropriate maintained contract: `LlmTrait` for
   LLM/VLM or `VlaRuntime` plus the Python policy layer for VLA.
8. Verify operators, transformations, intermediate checkpoints, eager and
   captured inference, host-transfer audit, public serving/policy integration,
   and requested performance. Report functional acceptance separately from
   optimization status (`target met`, `best effort with performance debt`, or
   `blocked`). Performance is best effort unless explicitly declared a release
   gate, but applicable existing optimized paths must be investigated.
9. Prepare a product-only diff. Keep checkpoints, captures, generated reports,
   temporary adapters, replay scripts, and agent state outside the repository.

## Stop conditions

Stop with a concrete blocker when the reference cannot run, semantics remain
unknown, canonical equivalence fails, a required kernel has no correct path, or
the maintained public integration cannot be exercised. A performance gap alone
is not a stop condition unless performance is an explicit release gate; exhaust
applicable existing paths, measure the gap, and report the remaining debt.
