name: model-port-workflow
description: Port a reference LLM, VLM, or VLA model into ApxInf with private evidence, model-layer isolation, kernel-gap handling, and end-to-end verification. Use when adding a model family, migrating a checkpoint/runtime, assessing operator coverage, or preparing a model-port review.

# Model Port Workflow

## Required reading

Read these repository documents before changing code:

1. [`doc/porting-workflow.md`](../../doc/porting-workflow.md) for the complete
   evidence and acceptance sequence.
2. [`doc/adding-a-new-model.md`](../../doc/adding-a-new-model.md) before creating
   or changing model-layer code. Follow its separate-directory and YAGNI rules.
3. [`doc/model-layer-architecture.md`](../../doc/model-layer-architecture.md)
   when deciding ownership, dependencies, runtime seams, or refactoring.
4. [`doc/adding-new-kernels.md`](../../doc/adding-new-kernels.md) whenever
   operator, dtype, layout, shape, or hardware coverage is missing.

Read each selected document completely. Treat them as instructions, not
background material.

## Workflow

1. Fix the reference revision, checkpoint identity, target, precision,
   representative inputs, tolerances, performance goals, and public API.
   Completion: every requested tuple and acceptance threshold is explicit.
2. Run the reference privately and capture deterministic inputs, outputs, and
   diagnostic tensors. Completion: the reference loads and repeated captures
   are attributable to the same source, environment, weights, and stochastic
   inputs.
3. Inventory semantics and weight transformations. Completion: every required
   computation is understood independently of its framework operator name.
4. Classify kernel coverage. Reuse model-neutral operations first. If a real
   gap exists, follow `adding-new-kernels.md`, then replay the returned
   implementation against the original references.
5. Create `crates/apxinf-model/src/<model>/`. Start with a self-contained
   implementation; copy a close model when useful and defer shared extraction
   until repeated maintained implementations prove the seam.
6. Integrate through the appropriate maintained contract: `LlmTrait` for
   LLM/VLM or `VlaRuntime` plus the Python policy layer for VLA.
7. Verify operators, transformations, intermediate checkpoints, complete
   inference, public serving/policy integration, and requested performance.
8. Prepare a product-only diff. Keep checkpoints, captures, generated reports,
   temporary adapters, replay scripts, and agent state outside the repository.

## Stop conditions

Stop with a concrete blocker when the reference cannot run, semantics remain
unknown, canonical equivalence fails, a required kernel has no correct path, or
the maintained public integration cannot be exercised. Report unmet
performance goals separately from correctness.
