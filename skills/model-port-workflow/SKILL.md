name: model-port-workflow
description: Port a reference LLM, VLM, or VLA model into ApxInf with private evidence, model-layer isolation, kernel-gap handling, and end-to-end verification. Use when adding a model family, migrating a checkpoint/runtime, assessing operator coverage, or preparing a model-port review.

# Model Port Workflow

## Required reading

Read these repository documents before changing code:

1. [`doc/porting-workflow.md`](../../doc/porting-workflow.md) for the complete
   evidence and acceptance sequence.
2. [`doc/adding-a-new-model.md`](../../doc/adding-a-new-model.md) before creating
   or changing model-layer code. Follow its separate-directory and YAGNI rules.
3. [`doc/model-layer-architecture.md`](../../doc/model-layer-architecture.md)
   when deciding ownership, dependencies, runtime seams, or refactoring.
4. [`doc/model-execution-wiring.md`](../../doc/model-execution-wiring.md) before
   implementing an executor or deciding that optimized coverage is missing.
5. [`doc/adding-new-kernels.md`](../../doc/adding-new-kernels.md) whenever
   operator, dtype, layout, shape, or hardware coverage is missing.

Read each selected document completely. Treat them as instructions, not
background material.

## Workflow

1. During preflight, ask once for hands-off or hands-on execution and the
   missing port inputs. Recommend hands-off and use it when an implementation
   request does not choose a mode. Offer discovered official GitHub source and
   Hugging Face checkpoint candidates; offer detected hardware defaults only
   for local Thor or Orin. Then fix the reference revision, checkpoint
   identity, target, precision, representative inputs, tolerances, performance
   goals, and public API. Do not silently pick user choices: record the
   confirmed or explicitly authorized tuple. Completion: every requested tuple
   and acceptance threshold is explicit.
2. Run the reference privately and capture deterministic inputs, outputs, and
   diagnostic tensors. Completion: the reference loads and repeated captures
   are attributable to the same source, environment, weights, and stochastic
   inputs.
3. Inventory semantics and weight transformations. Completion: every required
   computation is understood independently of its framework operator name.
4. Create an execution ledger from reference semantics through safe CUDA calls.
   Inspect maintained optimized executors and fused interfaces before the
   portable backend trait. Account for tensor lifetime, reusable KV/state,
   workspace, host traffic, and graph eligibility. Completion: every hot-path
   row has a device implementation, a named correctness scaffold with a device
   exit criterion, or a concrete blocker.
5. Classify fused and primitive coverage. If a real gap exists, follow
   `adding-new-kernels.md`, then replay the returned implementation against the
   original references. A CPU layer implementation is a named correctness
   scaffold with an exit criterion. On an accelerator target, replace every
   repeated hot-path scaffold with a safe device path; build cost and passing
   end-to-end values do not turn host round trips into deliverable performance
   debt.
6. Create `crates/apxinf-model/src/<model>/`. Start with a self-contained
   implementation. Treat every sibling model-family directory as private:
   inspect and copy a close model when useful, but never import from it or
   modify it to expose reusable symbols. Until a pre-existing, separately
   reviewed model-neutral module owns the needed API, duplicate the required
   code locally, including large blocks. A model port must not create an ad hoc
   shared module as a shortcut. Defer shared extraction to a separate review
   after repeated maintained implementations prove the seam. Run
   `scripts/check_model_family_boundaries.sh` before review.
7. Integrate through the appropriate maintained contract: `LlmTrait` for
   LLM/VLM or `VlaRuntime` plus the Python policy layer for VLA.
8. Verify operators, transformations, intermediate checkpoints, eager and
   captured inference, host-transfer audit, public serving/policy integration,
   and requested performance. Report functional acceptance separately from
   optimization status (`target met`, `best effort with performance debt`, or
   `blocked`). Performance is best effort unless explicitly declared a release
   gate, but applicable existing optimized paths must be investigated.
9. Prepare a product-only diff. Keep checkpoints, captures, generated reports,
   temporary adapters, replay scripts, and agent state outside the repository.

## Stop conditions

In hands-off mode, intermediate builds, numerical checkpoints, progress
summaries, and uncommitted changes are continuation points. Stop only at the
completion criteria, a concrete blocker, or an approval the agent cannot grant.
In hands-on mode, pause at named checkpoints with a concrete question and a
default next action, including whether to commit when that choice is useful.

Stop with a concrete blocker when the reference cannot run, semantics remain
unknown, canonical equivalence fails, a required kernel has no correct path, or
the maintained public integration cannot be exercised. A performance gap alone
is not a stop condition unless performance is an explicit release gate; exhaust
applicable existing paths, measure the gap, and report the remaining debt.

A partial foundation is not a completion condition. While safe in-scope work
remains, continue through the runtime, public integration, and end-to-end
reference comparison instead of ending with a list of unfinished components.
Stop early only when the next required action depends on unavailable external
information, authority, hardware, or artifacts, and state that dependency
precisely.
