//! Launch policy for the gated-delta-net kernels.

//! These constants are not hardware facts, so they do not belong in
//! [`CudaDeviceCaps`], whose contract is that it carries hardware only. They
//! are also not portable, so they do not belong hard-coded in the CUDA
//! adapter: every one of them was swept on a board and every one of them came
//! out different on the next board. Orin wants a chunk-state tile of 8 and a
//! chunk-gemm tile of 32; Thor wants 4 and 4, and its chunk-state curve is not
//! merely shifted but steeper -- 16 is 8% off the optimum on Orin and 26% off
//! here.
//!
//! So they live here: one table, chosen from the device, with a per-field
//! environment override so a new board can be re-swept without a rebuild. The
//! adapter does what it is told and asks the driver nothing.
//!
//! Re-sweep after changing any of these kernels. The optimum has moved once
//! already for the chunk-state block width, and it will move again.
